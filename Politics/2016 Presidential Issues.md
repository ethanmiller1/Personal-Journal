# Minimum Wage

The election for me is between Sanders and Cruz. I haven't decided on the issue of increasing minimum wage to $15 or maintaining it at $7.25. I foresee one of two things happening if minimum wage is increased. If we double the salary expenses of a given business they're going to have to increase service revenue proportionately to keep the income statement positive. To increase service revenue they raise their prices. At this point demand decreases because people aren't willing to pay more for their product, which keeps service revenues low and net income plummets. Well, the business can't cut cost of goods sold, depreciation expense, interest expense, rent expense, supplies expense, or utilities expense, so they've got to cut salaries expense. They can't lower the wage so the only thing left is to fire people, so now you've got families who were making $7.25 an hour who are now unemployed. Let's take a real life example. Look at Allen Bowl over on Greenville. They're working hard to pay their employees 10 an hour, the managers themselves are barely doing 20. Every cent they pay their employees over minimum wage comes out of their pocket. Raise minimum to 15 an hour and they're done. They can't stay in business. Their employees are now jobless making nothing and there's no more bowling alley on Greenville.

The only way a minimum wage increase is going to help us is if net income has enough cushion to allow for it. This is the second possible outcome I foresee. The owners might say, "We can't afford to raise prices because demand will plummet and we'll go out of business," so they just leave service revenue where it is, increase salaries expense, and let net income suffer. If net income is already high enough that they can afford that, good. But now this becomes a question of, "Are most businesses major industries that can afford that?" And if you run the number, the answer is no.

Do I think capitalism is being abused? Yeah, I do. If in the last fifteen years real median family income has dropped $5,000 dollars, and in the last 10 years middle class citizens' income has decreased by 36% ($130,000 to $81,000), while the top 0.1% wealthiest citizens has seen an increase of owning 10% of America's wealth in 1985 to 22% of America's wealth today, there is a problem. The argument here is that capitalism is being made into a framework for greed, but this is nothing new. Greed is the reason capitalism works. In an ideal world, communistic societies would work (at least economically speaking), because the incentive to create value by working and specializing and exchanging thereof would not be greed. If everybody was motivated by the needs of other people then they would do work in communistic societies. The concept of communism works, it's people who don't work. The problem with communistic societies in the real world is that by and large the underlying motivation for people's hard work is not the needs of other people, but survival, and greed, and "building bigger barns" so to speak. If you take away the motivation for hard work, you take away hard work, and then there are no goods and services left to distribute equally because nobody is producing them.

Now socialism is not oblivious that greed is the motivation for work, I just don't think the proposed solution pans out in reality. The socialist view asks the question, "How can we develop a system where greed motivates wealthy business owners to increase wages and thereby distribute wealth more equally?" Well, if U.S. law enforces them to increase salary expense, and economic law of demand forces them to keep product price down, their personal net income decreases significantly and wealth will be transferred back to the lower classes. And if they raise prices and fire employees to compensate for higher salary expenses, demand will decrease and put them out of business, meaning they can't afford to do that because then they won't make any money, thereby instituting greed as the motivation for sharing their wealth. It sounds like a good idea, but I have at least two concerns with this logic. The first is that the major industries probably can afford to raise prices and/or fire employees to make up the difference in their income statement, because their net income and production margins are so high anyway. If the greed of major business owners remains, forcing them to increase salaries expense won't accomplish anything because they'll just compensate by firing employees and increasing product prices. The only thing that will prevent them from doing that is if they'll go out of business by doing so, but large enough businesses won't. So this increase in minimum wage will probably cause unemployment and less demand in the market. A second problem is that most businesses in America are not major industries that have a huge net income in the first place, and therefore the majority of business owners are not the wealthiest citizens, so raising minimum wage won't actually address the problem of wealth inequality, it will only force businesses to shut down, making for less economic value being created because there's less businesses producing and exchanging goods and services for money. Less economic value created = more poverty. Since these small businesses can't afford to raise prices and/or fire employees (due to less demand in the market and/or less production as a result), they end up shutting down because they can't afford to double salary expenses either.

I don't like that the top 0.1% of wealthiest American citizens have doubled their share of wealth while that of the average middle class citizen has dropped 36%, but I sincerely do not believe raising minimum wage will solve the problem. I kind of want to try just to see how it pans out, but I think the stakes are too high to make politics into a sort of social experiment. If businesses go out of business, and employees lose their jobs, poverty will sweep across the nation and the enterprise of creating economic value will come to a standstill. If that happens, it would destroy families, not improve their quality of life or help support them.

# Healthcare

I would probably be in favor of healthcare as a right if healthcare actually lived up to its name, but the statistics tell a starkly contrasting story. Healthcare doesn't make people healthy; it makes money by getting people addicted to its drugs that short-circuit the body's natural way of releasing chemicals throughout the body. Healthcare doesn't recognize the intelligence of the body. It doesn't ask the question, "Why is the body doing what it's doing?" So no, I don't want to necessitate a system of care that makes money off of keeping people sick in this country. What we need is a leader who will fight the FDA's ban of natural remedies that actually work; chiropractic care, essential oils, homeopathic remedies. All of these make and keep people healthy. If government was offering that kind of care to people as a right, I wouldn't object. I would pay for that out of my tax dollars. But as it is, healthcare is the leading cause of death in America. Correctly prescribed medications are killing people because it is messing with the body's natural instincts for survival. We need to hone in on those instincts, not fight against them. But all healthcare does is fight against what the body is doing, and for that reason I cannot, I will not support it nor its advocates. We need leaders who look into the science of these things and doctors who treat patients as people rather than numbers.

Forget about these politicians and their rhetorical eloquence and eristic acrobatics to make their assumptions look like obvious conclusions that everybody should have. We have to ask the question, what is healthcare actually doing for our country? Medicines are killing us. Our bodies are our healthcare. They are designed for survival. In 19 years I have been hurt, sick, broken, had an acute torticollis, broke my arm, scraped my knee, battled compartment syndrome in my leg, inflammatory lungs, had terrible allergies for the first ten years of my life, and in all that time healthcare has never done anything for me. You want to know what stopped my allergies? It wasn't pumping chemicals into my body. That's what started them. What stopped them was a chiropractor by the name of Jim McCarty who put the 72 skull plates in my head back in place. This is the kind of care America needs, and this is the kind of lifestyle Americans deserve. We are a great nation. Let's not overlook the real-life applications of these issues.

The FDA is restricting natural methods of healthcare like essential oils and chiropractic practices to keep the wealthy drug producers happy. They aren't about getting people healthy, they are about getting people addicted so they'll come back and keep buying their drugs, and they are succeeding. Sickness is a huge industry in America. We need to usher in a new system that utilizes what the science is telling us and works with the body, not against it. We need the FDA to make candid regulations un-gripped from the influence of those who fund them into power so that we can advance the practices that are working, not suppress and illegalize them. It's corrupt and it's sick that people are dying and surrendering their health to make the rich even richer.

# 12-Weeks Of Medical Leave For New Moms

I think the relationship between a mother and her child is a non-negotiable. That being said, I don't believe in a system of government that promises to tuck in your kids at night. The government is there to do what individuals cannot do. Though, I don't think there is a problem in situations where families need the extra income, or single moms, and cannot afford to stop working, that an appropriate period of time should be appropriated to that bond. An entire quarter, though, seems a bit extensive. But in the long run, if they have four kids, that's a year of "sabbatical" and probably around 30 years of working, so I am not opposed to this policy.

# Abortion

I think the most important issue for me regarding the presidential election is the snuffing out of 1.2 million lives per year that are being identified as a woman's right. Do you know what a woman's most basic right is? Life. About 400 thousand Americans died in World War 2. We started a war over what ended up being 6 million Jews killed over 6 years, that's 1 million Jews every year.

# Bernie Sanders

Just found this comment on the democratic town hall debate, and I really think it hit the nail on the head for many things that Bernie Sanders stands for. If you haven't voted in the primary yet, and are looking for the best candidate, please read this:

For those who are still undecided, here are some highlights on presidential candidate Bernie Sanders 🇺🇸

Bernie wants to make healthcare available for everyone as a right, so neither you or your employer will have to pay health insurance directly, it's just provided for everyone as a human right through a small tax that will replace your current health insurance payments. His plan will end up saving the US $6 billion in the next decade compared to what we currently spend on health care and will actually SAVE the average household about 5,000 every year and the average business about $10,000 a year. We are the ONLY major country in the world that doesn't provide health care for their people as a right.

He wants to make sure all women get at least 12-weeks of medical leave after having a baby so they can get to know their new child and learn to be a mom (this plan will only cost americans $1.61 a week) and he wants pay equality for women. He has a 50-year history of standing up for civil and minority rights and was even present at MLK's "I have a dream" speech.

He wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 gradually within 4 years, a plan which top economists agree will strengthen our economy because the more money people make, the more they spend on products and services. When companies sell more products and services, they make more money and hire more people to meet those demands. This plan improves the quality of life and income for individuals as well as businesses.

He wants to cap credit card interest rates at 15%, he wants to cap ATM fees at $2 because people shouldn't have to pay up to $4.50 ($2 from the ATM and $2 or $2.50 for using a different bank than your own) to take out THEIR OWN money especially since ATM's save the banks money. He wants to equip the postal service with minor banking abilities so people in poor neighborhoods don't have to go to paycheck advance places and get ripped off.

He wants to keep the police accountable when someone dies while in custody. He wants to end private prisons (the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world and has more people currently in prison than China - a COMMUNIST country with 4.3 times as many people as the US.

He wants to give students the ability to refinance their student loans at a lower percentage rate and he acknowledges that a college degree is the same as a high school diploma in today's world and he feels that nobody should be deprived of an education because of their income or inability to pay off loans so he wants to make public colleges and universities tuition-free, this will be paid for through a tax on wall street speculation (high-risk investments). He feels it's wrong that the taxpayers bailed them out and they still gave themselves millions in bonuses and changed little of their behavior so it's their time to pay their fare share. He wants to break up "too big to fail" banks to prevent another financial collapse. He also wants to put those that caused the financial collapse in jail. He argues that a kid can go to jail for years and have their life and record ruined for smoking marijuana but the crooks on wall street that destroyed the lives of billions of people all over the world with their reckless behavior and greed just got a $700 billion bailout and a slap on the wrist.

He wants to end loopholes that save companies like wal-mart billions ($6 billion last year) while they push their employees to sign up for government assistance and he wants to end loopholes that allow companies to keep their money stashed in the cayman islands and other "tax havens".

He wants to close loopholes that allow people to buy guns online and at gun shows without background checks. He tries to avoid war which saves us trillions, he wants to take big money out of politics so the US can be a democracy again.

He wants to expand social security so that when you retire, you have a decent income to keep you alive and happy, not just barely getting by.

He's only 5 years older than Donald Trump, 6 years older than Hillary Clinton and 5 years YOUNGER than John McCain whose age became an issue 8 years ago when he ran against Obama and he's still alive and well.

Today, 62 people own HALF of the world's wealth...5 years ago that number was 388... Bernie cares about people like you and I...and he's funded by people like you and I...he's literally received more individual contributions ($27 average) than ANY presidential candidate EVER at this point in the race....all the other people running for president are funded by the same people that are turning america into a place where only the ultra-rich and powerful have a say in what goes on.

# Ben Carson

Carson is not eristic in any sense of the word, but I think that's a good things because it means he can't manipulate is with rhetorical eloquence, as is common in the art of politics. Abraham Lincoln was a great president, but it was because his ideals and character, not his ability to persuade people that he's the best candidate. What this country needs is someone who puts their efforts toward the issues and not the rules of persuasion.

# Hillary Clinton

I will not vote for somebody who identifies the mutilation of human life as a woman's right, who will watch millions of human lives snuffed out every year and do nothing about it, much less someone who endorses such practices.

# Donald Trump

I neither will vote for a man to lead us who owns a strip club,  and practices all forms of immorality.

"They are filled with envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are haters of God, insolent, haughty, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Although they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them."

I love how people ignore Trump's policy stances and position on issues and say they will not vote for him because of his character, as if the image projected by the media is sufficient portrayal of his character to make a good judgment. Do you really have that much faith in media that got think you can look that deep into his soul that you know what he's really like? Why don't we take off the blinders and look at what people who actually know him say about him. Does the media talk about the private conversation he has with his colleges that demonstrate his love for America? Please listen up, voters, if your going to make a character-based decision, please don't jump the gun on somebody you do not know.

I have to admit I was worried how well Trump was doing, I had him figured as an immature bully with an obsession with power and a short-tempered, with a disability of listening. However, I believe my initial judgements on him were entirely superficial, cherry-picked, and premature. I didn't like Cruz much better as I saw him divert and dance around questions with rhetoric absent of saying anything with substance at all. I don't think he would change very much in our country at all. Trump isn't playing the game, he's out to make America great again because he has a deep-seated love for the country.

I'm a little surprised at you, pastor, thinking you know enough about his man's character by what the media feeds you without having ever met him. It's one thing to learn about a candidates policy stances, but I don't think public media is a clear enough lens to look that deeply into another man's soul to know what he's really like. Truth is I was terribly nervous about this man becoming president, but I feel my initial judgements on him were entirely superficial, cherry-picked, and premature. By his own admission he hasn't asked God for forgiveness.  If you haven't checked out

Not saying I would be excited if he were to be our republican candidate, I'm just tired of people subscribing to a notion of the man's image that may well be as distorted as the Muslim conception of God.

I got scared reading what people who've never met him say about him, but when I listen to the people who actually know him, there is a starkly contrasting story.

This article is one of the most arrogantly written compositions I've read. Or has the author forgotten that no unwholesome words are to proceed from our mouths except that which is beneficial for edification, giving grace to those who hear? Is he a prophet when he says, "Trump will bring us sin without repentance and consequence without the mercy," that he thinks he knows that will happen tomorrow? Or when he calls Trump both indefensible and unjustifiable has he forgotten that we have a Great High Priest? He parades around on his high horse of theological intelligence. If he knows so much about God, then he knows God hates haughty eyes; yet he his entire article is written with arrogance. It isn't Trump's character that I find severely lacking and hypocritical in this article. Take the plank out of your eye, son.

It isn't character Trump is lacking in, it's morality.

If God waited around to use people of good character toward his ends, thermodynamics would claim the universe sooner.

Trump has no incentive to become president except to make America great again. In 1988 he said he'd probably never run for president because he loves what he's doing so much. He loves this country, he's a brilliant man, and he can make the difference in our foreign policies. We need to stop all the dumping going on in America, and Trump will fight for that.

Have you really become so disinterested in the good of this country? Have some foresight. Nobody else has expressed any resolution to the dumping from foreign countries in our economy that destroying our businesses. Something needs to happen. I don't think Cruz will change anything. I admire the man more, but in the end my vote will go to who I think will make this country better. If the man has no character why is he fighting for America? Not just himself, but for America. He's a wealthy man. He doesn't need to be concerned with the problems in our economy because his business practices overcome them. If he was only concerned about himself I don't believe we would want to help America become great again, but I believe he genuinely does, and therefore I will not be so arrogant to assert he has no character. If he can lead us to a greater America,

character-based politics and thinking

I have to admit I was worried how well Trump was doing, I had him figured as an immature bully with an obsession with power and a short-tempered, with a disability of listening. However, I believe my initial judgements on him were entirely superficial, cherry-picked, and premature. I didn't like Cruz much better as I saw him divert and dance around questions with rhetoric absent of saying anything with substance at all. I don't think he would change very much in our country at all. Trump isn't playing the game, he's out to make America great again because he has a deep-seated love for the country.

I think it's sick that you want to make a decision that will affect all of America based on whether or not this man's morality lines up with yours, which won't have any bearing on policy issues. Let's make this simple: look at the policy issues, vote for how you think America should be run.

I think it's silly when people refuse to eat at chick-fil-a because the CEO believes in traditional marriage. He has that right and it doesn't affect the food he makes. The right of belief is a God-given unalienable right; if it wasn't I expect God would coerce everyone into believing in Him whether or not we love Him, but He doesn't. He lets you chose. And if Trump choses death, that's his choice. Truly though, I think it's just ignorance, not refusal. He doesn't deny the name of Christ, he's just got his doctrine twisted. That's a product of our culture and the type of preaching he's been fed. How will anybody believe if nobody goes? But I don't think it will affect the way he runs this country. Another thing, don't be so naive to think that our little democracy makes it so that our authorities are elected and not appointed. There is no authority except from God, and those in authority are established by God. So instead of staying home because you have a problem with the candidates' doctrine and morality, recognize that God intends one of them to be president, and seek to discern His will through wisdom. Look at the Book. Apply its character and its spirit. Don't let election be about your opinions; it's always about His will. It's the age old question of God's sovereignty / predestination and our freewill. Do we freely elect our leaders? Yep. Has God predestined which one will be elected? Yep. This is what I see in the Bible, and there are no less than eight ways to reconcile it, but in the end they all have holes, and I'm willing to throw up my hands and say, "I recognize my freedom of will, and I recognize God's predestination." Rabbit.

One last thing, God ordained that men should be the head of the house in Genesis 3. He made man in the likeness and glory of God, and woman in the glory and man. It isn't for a woman to be in a position of authority, and that's my firm conviction aside from my personal policy differences with Clinton. I will always vote consistently with how I discern the spirit and character of God's will through the pages of His book. I don't understand why God hasn't raised up a more moral leader for America, but I trust in His wisdom and providence and know that His ways are higher than ours. His thoughts are not the same as my thoughts, they are higher, and so it would be fool hearted for me to make judgements based on my thoughts apart from His word.

We buy gas from Saudi Arabia, and I wouldn't place Trump's character even close to those people. I think Trump legitimately cares about America and he's going to be the one who can set things straight.

## Christopher Chavez critique and analysis of Donald Trump's "Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again"

Donald Trump is certainly an intelligent man, contrary to what the media portrays. I was previously skeptical about reading anything about him, since I was heavily influenced by Senator Bernie Sanders, but I took it upon myself to read about what the GOP is all about, and truthfully...it makes sense. Or rather, it just shows a different solution in a different light that meets the same end goals: we want what is best for America.

It was incredibly incorrect and foul of me to criticize Trump as a misogynistic racist who is uneducated and speaks in only third-grade level sentences (well - he still does, but the substance is more important than the delivery), but the fact of the matter is that liberals, conservatives, and independents should read about what their respective parties and political beliefs represent, as well as the work of their political adversaries. After all, "Know thy enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles, you will never be defeated. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated in every battle."

Just to deliver on what he represents, I'll outline what he writes and my thoughts on each. I will add on as I read every chapter throughout the day, and see if this changes my stances or not.

Chapter 3: "Immigration: Good Walls Make Good Neighbors": As a member of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), we involve our organization heavily on this topic, so I feel as though I do have insight from both sides on this. Trump is NOT anti-immigration, or anti-Hispanic (crazy, right?). The fact of the matter is, Trump (if we believe in what he says, and not the media) is for immigration, but legally. Erecting a wall, reforming immigration laws (whereby those with efforts to increase valuable skills and education easier access to citizenship), reinterpretation of "Jus Solis" (birthright citizenship by the 14th amendment), and refusal to support "sanctuary cities" are his key points on immigration. These are valid arguments, and I do not condone them as racist. Quite contrary, they're fairly reasonable. I think his main objective is following the law of our constitution, reforming laws so that cities and citizens follow REASONABLE laws (and not those we have currently), and to remove illegal criminals and to make society in general better. This is what America should represent.

To surmise this, Trump is for actual and lawful reform. He is more normative than positive in that he WANTS to fix immigration to be better, and make it legal. What we are doing with sanctuary cities and giving the benefit of the doubt to illegal immigrants is "good" since likely many are here to build a better life and to increase American values. But at the end of the day, this is illegal, which is precisely why we need to reform these laws. Create a pathway to citizenship if you live by American values, are trustworthy, hardworking, and are a benefit to society. This is reasonable to me.

Chapter 4: "Foreign Policy: Fight for Peace." Trump is heavy on the rhetoric that if we are in your country and keeping it stable, you should be paying the United States. This comes down to whether we should downsize our military, or increase it. I believe Trump is a Keynesian here since he wants to spend more in order to add more manufacturing and military jobs by expanding this governmental force. What he believes in is that the U.S. Military should be peacekeeping, not nation building, and that war is a last resort.

"My rules of engagement have always been pretty simple - if we are going to intervene in a conflict, there had better be a direct threat to our national interests. The threat should be so obvious that most Americans will know where the hot spot is on the globe and will quickly understand why we are getting involved. Also, we'd better have an airtight plan to win and get out." (Trump 36)

Now Trump is for formally declaring war on ISIS. But rather than a huge campaign, he is for sending a limited but sufficient number of troops to fight on the ground. He is adamant about having an air campaign on the funding sources of ISIS (i.e. oil fields) which could cripple the enemy by cutting of their supply lines. He is also against the Iranian Nuclear deal, supporting Israel, and imposing even more sanctions against Iran.

On China however, I believe Trump falls flat. He provides no solution, only that we need to stop China from devaluing their currency and to have "the best negotiators" create a good trade deal for America. Negotiations to stop their protectionist policies are viable, and if we do increase the military budget for cyber warfare and defense, we could stop their repeated cyber theft. But there's not actual definitive points to his foreign policy with China, which is quite underwhelming for Trump. I wonder what he truly believes for China and how he might change the current situation.

Chapter 5: 'Education: A Failing Grade": Education ran locally, not "top-down" is key with Trump. Eliminate the Department of Education, Common Core, NCLB, and Race to the Top. Give power back to communities, PTAs, and local school boards. And on some aspects, he's right: public education does feel like you're gaining a certificate of attendance, not a diploma. My education wasn't as valuable at Wylie High School as it is currently at Collin College. You're packed in filled classrooms where half the students don't care and disrupt classes, being taught to the test, and teachers handing out packets and not being enthusiastic about teaching. This is wrong, and education needs a serious overhaul. I'm thankful for having BPA and dual credit when I was in high school since I learned from those classes and not the other ones, but government ran schooling is inefficient, and honestly caps the success of students to their full potentials.

Trump is also in favor of "school choice." Invoking competition would eliminate the bad in favor of the good. This is common sense and is what we do not have in our education. Smaller class sizes, more individualized instruction, and stricter discipline made a night and day difference in what college is vs high school. The curriculum is more rigorous, but instructional methods and how classes are supposed to function is better in college than it ever will be in high school. If you're disruptive in class, you're out. Plain and simple. High school should function the same.

Trump's policy on higher education loans is that there should be no interest on Federal student loans. Yes, a Republican actually believes this. I think he could've gone further into what we should do for higher education, but making interest-free loans over making public universities tuition-free makes more sense to me. Education is not a right, it's a privilege. Does this mean that those who cannot afford it can't go? No. There are many pathways to college. Community college then transferring to a university already shaves off 50% of your tuition. The first two years of your basics costs a little over $1000 a semester, or $4k in total. How does that compare to a year over in a university where you could be paying nearly $20k a year for tuition, fees, textbooks, room and board, etc? Not only that, but transfer scholarships are given to those who are competitive. (Terry scholars, SMU Mustang scholars, etc.)

An educated society is good, but we can't have all scholars and nothing else? Why don't we have more secondary students do it like in Germany where you can decide on trade school, universities, military, etc. early on and do what you love? College is such a huge industry in America today, and our government subsidizes these schools to create the fanciest of football stadiums, hotel-like dorm halls, rock climbing walls, etc. Where do we stop and say that maybe we should invest in a diverse range of things rather than one thing that could put us into debt and potentially cause more damage than good? This is one area where I didn't agree with Sanders. This is an expensive expenditure that doesn't seem viable to me. If we stop subsidizing college, colleges will have to put the real rate of tuition, which students will likely search for different viable options and lower attendance, therefore making colleges competitive and lower costs. I am not against higher education, but we do need to keep a capitalistic society in play that works over subsidizing something that shouldn't be subsidized.

Wow. Trump really challenged me on this. There's still 15 more chapters in this book and I'm excited to read more into it. Thoughts?

Chapter 6: "The Energy Debate: A Lot of Hot Air": So Trump's stance is what liberals, and myself included, as "killing the environment." Only, it's quite the opposite. Green technologies such as wind and solar, by his definition, along with Bill Gates and many other reputable economists, as inefficient for it's costs. Green technologies may also be hurting the environment more, especially wind turbines, for using gas powered starts that reduce the efficiency of it, making it less efficient than current gas and oil methods of producing energy. Trump believes in transferring the budgets of subsidization of green energy into the R&D of green technologies. We should become energy independent and cut off the needs for OPEC. I actually didn't believe this, but it makes sense, if his data supports his means.

Now he does support fracking which, in my opinion, is bad. There are widespread reports of gasoline getting into water lines in Oklahoma and other states from using this, which I believe has not been research enough. Along with that, earthquake activity has been increased from areas that use fracking. So if possible, I would like to look into this matter before taking Trump's word on his energy policies.

Chapter 7: "Health Care is Making Us All Sick": Trump is against cutting Social Security or Medicare benefits. He also wants to deregulate the insurance industry and let companies compete across state lines. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas could now follow you anywhere in the United States. That's pretty much it. Very limited info in this chapter, but his website has more on the matter: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform

He's not longer for single-payer healthcare, which is disheartening. I'm huge on socializing healthcare since our private plans are hugely inefficient. I've recently come to believe that private-public payer options may be even better than single payer. But the Austerity economic form of healthcare may be better than the current PPACA. He is even keeping some provisions of it, such as not being able to be denied due to preexisting conditions. Who knows, maybe this method is better than the European or Canadian models.

Chapter 8: "It's Still the Economy, Stupid": Trump is good at beating his chest I'll say that much. He is big on practical realism and common sense, not the "theory" approach. Rather than cutting Social Security, he wants the option to opt-out of the system. I don't believe Social Security will be available to me when I'm older, and I'm more self-sufficient and trusting in my IRAs and future 401(k)s and other investments. Many young people would agree with me too. He also realizes that there is a huge difference between the Labor Participation Rate and the Unemployment Rate, which Democrats point to (which can be misleading).

Changing the tax codes so that companies want to manufacture here, stop allowing other countries to devalue their currency, creating better trade agreements, and more is on Trump's plan.

Take a few minutes to read it. This is coming from a conservative that does not support Trump.

Interesting take on Trump.

What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency  
By Bill Bennett-

They will try to kill him before they let him be president.  
It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.  
Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.

It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media. They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another. It's one for all and all for one.

It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened.

Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.

It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the good old boys club. They talk big, but they won't change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors.

They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations – like Big Pharmacy or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary and their Clinton Foundation donations.

These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. But there's one man who isn't beholden to anyone.

There's one man who doesn't need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher's union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.

Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn't need anyone's help. That means he doesn't care what the media says. He doesn't care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.

Don't you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don't you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama?

Don't you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to defund Obamacare or Obama's clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?

First, I'd guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.

Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything.

Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists, so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment.

Fourth , why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you're a good old boy, you've got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.

But Trump doesn't play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump.

Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama's birth certificate. He questioned Obama's college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he's doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He's questioning our relationship with Mexico; he's questioning why the border is wide open; he's questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he's questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he's questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he's questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.

Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question!

I'm certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion.

Trump will ask if Obamacare's architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama's widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama's college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?

Obama, the multinational corporations and the media need to stop Trump. They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant.

Trump's election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked books and Obama's records, the game is over.

The jig is up. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money.

Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison.

Obamacare will be de-funded and dismantled. Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That's why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.

Yes, it's become open season on Donald Trump.

The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses and if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can't silence him. And they sure can't intimidate him.

The more they try, the more the public will realize that he's the one telling the truth.

## Minimum Wage

So I do think that capitalism is a better alternative to communism.

Whereas in a capitalist society, you have people being motivated by greed who work (true), but you also have people working who are motivated by giving, and they do give. The most generous people in the world are those at the forefront of capitalism.

Capitalism = work by those motivated by greed + work by those motivated by giving = giving from those who are motivated by giving

Communism = work by those motivated by giving = giving from those who are motivated by giving

The people who are motivated by greed, in this scenario, don't work and therefore become dependent on those who are motivated by giving. This increases the amount of consumers and decreases the amount of workers, making for a less wealthy society.

In an ideal world, communism would be better than capitalism.

That's not what it should be about. The problem of wealth inequality is not the amount of goods and services in America, it's the distribution thereof. In the real world, people go hungry not because there isn't enough food in the world to feed them, but because the wealthiest people who are at the forefront of capitalism care more about green paper than the needs of other people.

Please understand, I am not anti-socialism or anti-communism, I just don't think they are realistic ideologies. If everybody was rightly and perfectly motivated,

The reason I think capitolism is a better idea is because people are not rightly motivated,

Capitalism isn't about not giving to other people, it's about not having it stolen from you. It isn't about greed, it's about giving. Giving changes people. It does. Having it taken from you to give to someone else changes people to.

Capitalism is really only a better idea because people are not rightly motivated. Our main goal is not to feed these people's physical hunger so they can live a few more years on the earth. Our main goal is to feed their souls so they can live eternally with Jesus in a city of God. The reason we feed their bodies is because priority assumes urgency, not importance.

I think that's a gross distortion of capitalism. The most generous people in the world should be those at the forefront of capitalism, but the numbers tell a starkly contrasting story. They would rather double their share of wealth than distribute it towards those in need.

I think of when my Grandmother died, and her will was to give 50% of her wealth to Colleen, her fifth child, and the rest was evenly distributed among the other four. Gary, her third child, deserved the 50% more than Colleen. He was the one who cared for her, spent time with her and the like. But she gave not in accordance with who deserved it most, but who needed it most.

Capitalism isn't about keeping everything you earn, it's about having an incentive to work because you know it won't be stolen from you. Reaping fruit from a garden you planted should not be our excuse to withhold from giving, it ought to be our motivation for giving.

Free enterprise should not be our excuse to withhold from giving, it ought to be our motivation for giving. But no, no, no, our motivation always tands toward greed instead of giving.

Capitalism ought to be motivated by giving, not keeping.

make economics work care more about

It's not panning out that way. Do I think socialism is a better idea? No. What we really need is to deal with the heart of the problem, and that's the heart of the people who are at the top of the totem pole.

If the greed of high wealth residents remain, forcing them to increase salaries expense won't accomplish anything because they'll just compensate by firing employees. The only thing they will prevent them from doing that is if they'll go out of business by doing so. Greed is always going to be the motivation for them, and the socialist view is saying,

everything the economic specialization will come to a standstill. #creation of value by exchanging goods.

Politics is really all about social experiments. "If we do this, people will behave a certain way." Psychology ought to be at the forefront of politics.

suffer and take the beating.

can't afford to raise their prices because they'll go out of business, they'

other outcome I see happening is

Believe me Kristina, I wish businesses who could afford it would pay their employees better.
