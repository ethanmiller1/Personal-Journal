# Maslonion Standards Of Value

If any two of these needs are in conflict, the lower need will dominate. In Sim City, a game where you're the Mayer of a simulated city, the first thing you need to give your sims is water. Then they're happy for a little while. Then they start to want power. Then they want garbage solutions. Then they want parks. They want better transportation when roads get congested. The whole game is about building a city, and the way you build a city is by this dynamic of need>solution. They have a problem or something they want, and you figure out a way to implement it.  They begin to want education.

## Physiological Needs (beneficial):

All needs become secondary until these needs are met. These are the basic things you need to survive. If you lack one of these four things you would die.

### Air:

In the very beginning when God first created Adam, it says he  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. Without air you can survive for about 3 minutes.<sup>1</sup> An average person taking 16 breaths per minute for 80 years will take about 674 million breaths in his lifetime.<sup>2</sup> That's a lot of breathing! How much does it cost? Lucky for us, the Bible says breath is a gift from God, something that we get for free out of his rich generosity.<sup>3</sup>

However, as most of us know, "Life is not measured by how many breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away" (Maya Angelou). Life is more then breathing, so let's keep going.

# Vertical Farming

The people that are going to end world hunger are going to be the farmers. People say, "You can't do business that way." Absolutely you can. WinRAR has shown that. What WinRAR has done is allowed an infinite 40 day trial for their product that allows users to use their product for free forever, and they make more money than any other competing product on the market. Why? Because people will buy even if they can get it for free. Commercial businesses will buy it out of legality, individuals will buy it out of values coupled with ability, or out of guilt; but the bottom line is you can actually give your product away and still make money. Why would people buy food from commercial businesses that buy it from farmers if they could get it for free? Because they can afford it. You say, "That sounds nice, but it won't pan out." Absolutely there will be people that exploit it. No question. But there will also be people who play by the rules, and there will be enough people who play by the rules to sustain flourishing business. Why? Look, work is hard, but people who don't work get depressed. A paycheck is not the only incentive. People are going to start realizing this. We live in a world today where only a small percent of the population actually needs to work to create enough goods for the whole world to have a decent life. I believe the number of people that will work out of choice rather than necessity will exceed the number of people that are necessary to fulfil all stages of Maslow's hierarchy. People want something to do. There will be incentives to work besides climbing up Maslow's hierarchy. I believe that. Especially in the church. There is no reason that the church shouldn't live in community (a capitalist twist on communism, or voluntary communism, as it were) like they did at the beginning. Members of a church who are being maintained by the church under a pastor who is helping them grow in sanctification will obey the commands in the Bible that the pastor is responsible for enumerating. I believe that. They will work. "If a man would not work, neither let him eat." That's Bible. There is no philosophy of mine that can argue with it. I can't just say, "I believe every person is entitled to the basic necessities of survival that are enumerated in Maslow's hierarchy." I can't even say a person should have that, because I'd be arguing with the Bible and I'm smart enough to know that God's smarter than me. But I will say this: in Paul's day a famer could grow enough food for about 10 people. Everybody needed to work or you'd end up like James Town. Today, a hundred fold. Technology works for us. Our intelligence works for us. We grow 100 fold the food for a small fraction of the work it used to take. That's astonishing. Maybe, just perhaps, if Paul was here today, he might've said something different. "If a man would not work, take away his TV." Maybe. "If a man would not work, neither let him have access to the highest stages of Maslow's hierarchy provided by the church." "If a man would not work, neither will he rejoice." Because he will be depressed. I don't know. That's not what the Bible says, so I'm not going to get carried away. But I think we need to be mindful that perhaps, just maybe, when Jesus said, "Feed the hungry, clothe the naked," he meant it. Inside the church, if people aren't getting it, then we can take measures. Paul was way more strict with believers than unbelievers. John asid pure and undefiled religion is this: caring for the orphans and widows. Let's do that. Let's distribute the incredible wealth we have to the the world so that we can all climb Maslow's hierarchy together. The higher up people are, the greater technology they will have, and the greater technology they posses, the more efficient their work will be, and the more efficient their work becomes, the wealthier the world will be. Think about how much work is wasted in third world countries. Imagine a whole village out there with their machetes cutting grass every month, when one person with a lawn mower could get the job done with less work every single week. It isn't surreal to you, but there are countless hours of wasted work being poured out across the globe because people don't have more efficient technology. We need to advance. Listen, if all the labor hours in these countries translated into American labor hours, into collegiate labor hours, the world would be so wealthy we wouldn't know what to do with our wealth. We might start taking care of the earth better. We might start using more solar energy. The reason we don't is because to advance the technology, startup costs are very expensive. If it takes 1000 labor hours to cut grass, and the same job can be done in 10 labor hours with a lawn mower (both more time efficient and quality effective), that frees up 990 labor hours to put towards something else. Even if we assume 90% of people just drop out of the workforce, which I think is an absurdly untrue number, you're still 99 labor hours ahead of the game than if you don't equip them with the lawn mower. Those 99 labor hours can be used towards other inputs. In accounting, labor hours is your dominant cost driver, and there are 8 types of waste. Let's cut down the waste and start motivating people to work because they want to. I have a project called "Till" that I think will create herder working people than a paycheck could dream to. Work begins in the mind. It begins with philosophy. Let's address that instead of this operant conditioning way of doing things, "Here, I'll give you this chocolate if you'll do this thing even though it's completely unrelated." That's not the future. The future is math, and business, and psychology, and theology, and technology. It's Khan Academy and individualized learning, not coerced learning. It's Till and individualized working, not coerced working. I won't get to see this happen before I die, but I will witness the beginning the a paradigm shift that will change the world. All of my words will be lost in a our-of-control array of information being imposed on the world. So I won't waste my time writing; the only way I'll see this change is by talking and persuading and doing.

Listen, I'm not a communist. Things need to be voluntary, that's why I'm using words and persuasion instead of a gun. I'm not trying to persuade the people who have guns to use them to steal from wealthy people and give to poor people. That's not what I'm about. What I'm about is persuading the wealthy people directly to live their lives this way. Not persuading someone who can coerce wealthy people to live this way at the end of a gun point. That's not communism, that's anarchy. Straight up. (Well, okay, so it's called "communism," but that word is too beautiful to be used that way. It's essentially, "Community-ism," and that is too nice a word to belong to such a horrendous philosophy.)

Politics is always a question of psychology, because it's about people. It's about our shared life together. It's about how we will behave in response to certain ideologies, certain policies, certain laws and regulations. How can we govern our shared life together to stipulate it in such a way that we take care of each other? Government's job is to make itself unnecessary. Let's address the mind. How we function as a society and as people will depend on the values, the philosophies, and the learning that determines the way that we think. Education (not grades, and history, and algebra, but enlightenment, ispiration, seeing the world in a new, beautiful and true way) is ultimately the foundation of our future. Hitler said, "Whoever owns the youth owns the future." Paychecks are not the most influential force in the world. Ideas are. That's where we need to begin if we want to change the world. Look at Jesus: he changed the world with words. Yes, he did miracles. Yes, he died and rose from the dead to save them that are perishing, and that is the outshining, outstanding, emphasis and point of the gospel, and I don't want to water that down in the slightest when I say this: The way Jesus changed the world was with words. With ideas. He got inside the motivations and work ethics and patience, ultimately the mind and way of thinking of other people by using words. They're so powerful, and we need to realize that. We literally have the power to change minds, to shape the motivations of our future, of our youth, and we just want to say wave a paycheck in their face and say, "I'll give you this if you do something useful."? That's borderline criminal. It's the easy way out. It's, ironically, lazy. You are being lazy in the way you get people to work when you reduce the motivation of working to, "I'll give you a reward." Work for reward. What about the making something? I think one of the value distortions (i.e. when someone pays me $200 dollars to make a video, my eyes widen and say, "Is the value of $200 worth of food actually equivalent to a 3 minute video?" Maybe. You need to somehow quantify the value of a video in terms of and in relation to something else (like $200 of food).  It depends on the value of the idea that the video is presenting in comparison with what $200 can otherwise buy. Otherwise I'd say, "Nope, won't take that much, because this video is not that valuable) in the world is that people don't think of their labor hours to product ratio in terms of what it could be. They don't think of what they're doing, what they're producing, what they're making. I wrote a paper about this same principle of operant conditioning in relation to the education system, and I opposed it there too, receiving a 100. I don't have personal-gain biases against it. I flourished in school. I think it's ineffective. And so is the way we're doing work. That is, the way we're spending our hours, getting money, spending money, etc. We need first of all to learn to quantify value to some standard so that we can quantify some standard of labor hours to product ratio, so that we can then determine which kinds of work are more useful than other kinds, which kinds we should improve, and which kinds we should tell people: this is valuable work. Currency isn't doing that accurately because it's all based on what people are willing to pay, and that's completely subjective. There's no actual intrinsic value associated with a product in regards to its usefulness. Sales men, business men, all kinds of people are really good at making something appear more valuable than it is. This causes value distortions and that makes some professions seem more valuable than they are, and people need to know how valuable their work is. We need to be able to evaluate that objectively in terms of what we're producing. Arbitrary things like ideas, or intangible things like services are harder to weigh against goods on a scale, but there has got to be a way to do it. I'm going to think about that during my free time (if ever I come to some). The reason I want accurate evaluations is not for reasons of trade: "Hey, I make pants, all you make is hats. That's not a fair trade!" but for reasons people being able to make informed decisions about how their time will be most effectively used.

"Well then you'd have to evaluate literally millions of professions." Impracticality is never a reason to veto an idea that has the potential to revolutionize the world and end world hunger. Impossibility is worth considering. Impracticality is not. Everything should be done with as much math as possible. As much objectivity and and defined standards as possible. String theory is an attempt to put all the laws of science into a single string of equations (or rather, a single-string equation). Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Rules simplify the inputs that go into them. We can't let value be subjective or the usefulness of our time will be nebulous and we'll make unwise decisions.

The wisest decisions we can make are those decisions which produce a product that lasts forever. There's 4 catigories of things to spend your money on: things that last a few hours, things that last a few years, things that last a lifetime, and things that last for eternity. Each of those things becomes more valuable as it moves up the list. A car is worth more than a piece of candy. An education is worth more than a car. Saving a soul from eternal anguish is worth more than an education. If we want to be wise with our time, we will recognize the most useful thing we can do, the highest labor-hour to product ratio is things that we do that the product is eternal, because then we're plugging a value of "infinite" into the numerator. Let's learn to discern the will of God and do it. That's the most valuable thing you can do. I'll save you lifetimes of trouble and summarize it: "Only one life, twill soon be past / Only what's done for Christ will last." None of us should get so caught up with saving the world from hunger that we neglect to save them from eternal hunger. If we give them water, they will thirst again. If we give them living water, they will be quenched forever. What's more valuable? "Thy Kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven." The Kingdom is a people. Every Kingdom is. We are the Kingdom of God, and it's his ambition for us to love here the way we will live there. Do we become so heavenly minded that we're earthly useless? We become so heavenly minded that we're earthly amazing. We have to get that right. We can't spend so much time reading the Bible that we never have time to do what's it's telling us. Part of what it tells us is to take care of the needy as if it were Christ. Are we going to say to Jesus if we saw him naked and hungry, "If you will not work, neither shall you eat!" Or, "Be fed, and be warm," and do nothing? I don't know about oyu, but I would make haste to feed him and clothe him. Why aren't we running to third world countries to do it for them? Jesus said whatever you do for them, you did for me. I believe that. We should all believe that. But none of us live like we believe it. It's time to change that. (And in your heart you're going, "Yeah! Woohoo!" but when I give you practical steps to take, you're heart drops a little, because you've been convicted, and you don't want to live by it.)

I think a fairly practical standard to weigh labor hours against is a modified version of Maslow's hierarchy, nested with a function of Kent Hovind's categories of value against time.

People like Elon Musk, Derek Muller, Kahn; these are our future. A future where education portal is free and accessible and provided to everybody so that they have the means to increase the value of their labor hours by increasing their knowledge and skill.

# Qualification (PhD are just three letter)

I need someone with a voice to say all this for me, because apparently being smart isn't good enough, you have to have letters before your name. We live in a world where that does not need to be the case at all. Letters before a name means you didn't have the discipline to study independently, so you needed to hire someone to keep you on track. There is a world of information, and you don't need to get a PhD to be exposed to the high standards of scholarship and research scholars are expected to adhere to (and in some cases, don't). I can access J-store, evaluate credibility, find credible sources, do proper research, evaluate positive and negative control groups, and have the basic knowledge that Wikipedia isn't going to cut it without ever walking into a school. Being smart about the way you do research isn't hidden and only accessible by virtue of someone else telling you. You can access more quality information on Google than in a classroom. You can read textbooks without being in a class where you listen to the lecture and never actually open the textbook. How many college students say that every semester? "I never even bought the book." I heard it all the time. I even started out that way, because you frankly didn't need them. But the information in them was more valuable, I learned, then the information in lectures. I can learn either route. I'm a visual, audial, kinesthetic learner. I can do distance learning, I can do face to face. It's all the same to me. Which is rare. But I can do it. I get A's no matter what. Either route. The point is you don't need to go to college to be an independent researcher. "People call me the Erin Brockovich of this industry because I'm not a doctor, I'm an independent researcher who has a passionate mission. Just as Erin Brockovich was not an attorney, but she was responsible for the largest class action lawsuit to ever hit this country" ([Tocco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjGYgvnbJbM&t=166s&list=WL&index=143)). "Well, you didn't follow MLA format. How unscholarly." Yeah, because MLA format came from an outdated system before hyperlinks where you had to go to a library and pick out the resource by the information provided if you wanted to fact check. Now you can pull up the resource with the click of a button. "Well they don't know if it's a credible source or not." First of all, don't pretend anybody has every credible journal memorized. Second, I am still providing that information in the footnotes, where you don't have to go all the way to the bibliography to check them. Thirdly, FACT CHECK. I could be lying about where I got the source. Students do it all the time. I know because my friends were students, and they did it. I did it. Hyperlinks are a good way of making things a lot easier and with a tighter grip on the facts. "It's a book." At least hyperlink to it in a college library or something. Now that you can hyperlink, Chicago style makes for sense in my opinion. It's more seamless. Maybe when someone doesn't follow standards, it's because they've found a better way of doing it. These are the people who make things better in the world, who advance standards, and progress innovation. We need people without degrees, people who had the discipline and aptitude to do it themselves. In my opinion, that's more prestigious than a doctrinal thesis. "We need some system of recognition so we know who to trust." Here's a thought: Don't trust anyone. We don't need to anymore. We have information at our fingertips. How stupid our we to assume somebody can be trusted because they got a PhD? Did they lose the ability to lie? Are they just above biases now? That's nonsense. Degree or no degree, we should be analyzing the arguments, not the person offering them. It's just inverse ad hominem. Instead of "Against the man," it's "Trust the man if he has three letters before his name." Letters before a name does not make the argument good. The argument makes the argument good. The logic makes the argument good. That's why Plato said it's the only necessity. Ethos and Pathos are tools of persuasion, not tools of good argumentation. Persuasion basically means: I'm going to nudge your beliefs with something other than sound reasoning. It's manipulation. Persuasion that uses ethos and pathos is deceptive. It's getting you to believe something without regards to the facts. It elicits emotions. He causes you to overlook things because you trust the person presenting. All of that is manipulation. That should never be used. We should allow people the liberty of analyzing only the facts, unadulterated, no sugarcoating, to nudging, no biases and produces. Persuasion by ethos and pathos is the offspring of confirmation bias. If the facts check out, let them make their own decisions. I'm not going to appeal to emotions and my own credibility to make an argument. Here's what I think, if you like it, great, if not, let's talk about it. But I'm not going to manipulate an audience to believe something by using persuasion tactics. That's what people who have something to hide do. That's what the Hitler's of the world do. That is not what good scholarship does. Period. Good teachers give you the facts and let you draw the conclusions. Good studies give you the facts and tell you what they think about what it infers, but they don't make the conclusion equal to the facts. We need to get out of this mindset that people need to have gone to college to be heard. There is nothing you can learn at college that you can't learn without it. There are a plethora of YouTube comments that agree, "I've learned more on YouTube then my entire collegiate career." I can attest to that.

In YouTube education they tell you to start where you're audience is at, so I've done my best to simplify things, but this is either going to work, or it's not.

# Learning "Disabilities"

So-called learning disabilities are no excuse to not learn. Albert Einstein had dyslexia. Many of the world's most accomplished scholars had learning "disabilities."  All there has to be is one exception to show that these people have the ability to learn. Disability means they don't have the ability, and that's why I have a problem with it. "Learning hindrance" I wouldn't cringe at so much, but still a little, because it's devised mainly as an excuse for people who claim them to say, "See, it's not that I'm not trying, it's that I can't do it." Maybe. But more often you're just lazy with your mind like people can be lazy with their hands. There are no excuses. You have dyslexia? You just raised the bar of expectation to Albert Einstein's intelligence. If he can do it, you can do it. Just don't listen to traditional teaching methods that are unsympathetic to your way of learning. Teach yourself to learn, and you will excel. My sister had a learning disability. But you know what? She was also lazy in other areas of life. Undisciplined and unplanned and very anti-goal oriented. I don't think she had a disability. I think she was mentally lazy, not mentally challenged. Listen, thinking challenges everybody. Some people push through it, some people give up. It's like anything in life. Don't be lazy. Don't get frustrated. Discipline takes more patience then anything else. More important than planning, then will power, is patience. People that call themselves mentally disabled are just lazy. Just like people who lose at running call themselves slow. People that lose arm wrestling don't make the excuse, "it's not fair because you're stronger than me." He worked to get strong. Don't tell me about what's fair until you've labored to get where I am. I hate it when people say, "You're just really smart and Deborah has learning disabilities," because that subtly implies that it was just easy for me. Like it just came naturally for me. No, I worked hard for it! I pressed my brain to the limits when we did flash cards as kids. It takes a lot of work for me to listen and concentrate on things. But I worked at it, and I overcame the pushback by making decisions to keep on doing it even when my brain felt like it's prefrontal cortex needed a fire extinguisher. I used to get headaches all the time. I read at about 100 words per minute. That's slower than many people with dyslexia! But I keep on reading. Being smart isn't something I was just born with. I worked for it. And when you make the distinction, "Deborah has learning disabilities and Ethan is smart," I cringe because I worked for it and Deborah was lazy. Maybe she did spend more time studying then me. It's because she spent less effort then me. Less work forcing herself to concentrate then I did. She was slack with her work, and therefore it took her longer. I was trained to work hard. And look where we are now: I wake up at 5:30 in the morning. She wakes up whenever she feels like it. She takes naps. She's tired all the time. She doesn't read her Bible. She doesn't really do anything. It's the same principle. I spent years sleeping in past noon. I had major trouble waking up in high school. My eyes were so heavy in the morning I could barely muster the strength to open them. But I memorized verses, and I listened to sermons, and I asked for a wake-up light for my birthday, and I researched techniques to wake up, and ultimately now I can wake up with energy because I pushed myself past the tiredness, and my body said, "If I'm going to have to work anyway I'm just going to quit this tired game." I take cold showers. I run in the morning to teach myself endurance. You can tell me I was just born smart and Deborah was born with a learning disability, but the truth is I made decisions to be competitive and to work hard and to push past my limits, and Deborah made decisions to be lazy, and everything about our lives testifies to that. "Introvert vs. extrovert." Stop it. Your brain is not the essence of your intelligence or your conscious thought. Your brain does not make decisions. You do. Wisdom comes from God. Let him that lacks wisdom ask God.

"Wow, you're strong! You were just born with the natural tendency to get strong. This weak person over here was just unfortunate to be

The biggest problem in the world today is laziness. I used to say it was pornography, but now I say it's laziness. Because you know why people do pornography? It's because they're lazy. You say, "How does that connect?" Listen, God said to Cain, who was offering the inferior fruit, "If thou doest well shalt though not be accepted? And if thou doest not well sin layeth at the door." Idle hands are the devil's workshop. When you're lazy, and you're not being fruitful, then there will be other sins like lust in your life. If you're busy, and you're working hard, and you labor in travail night and day, you suddenly don't have time to do pornography, and you learn principles of discipline that enable you to guard your heart with all diligence, having verses to say like, "Keep mine eyes away from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way." Jesus said the fruitful branch will be pruned that it may bear more fruit. As you begin to work for the Lord, God will cut out the sins in your life. But if you're lazy, and you aren't being fruitful, you will be cut off. You're not going to be in communion with Jesus because your sins will distort your vision of him, so even if you're not hindered by a seared and condemned conscience that keeps you away out of shame, you still won't have a good relationship because it's the pure in heart that see God. If you want to stop doing porn, get to work. Stop wasting time, be wise about your time like it says in Ephesians 5. Budget you hours. Even if you're young you should have at least 8 labor hours everyday applied towards studying to qualify you for work, in addition to the hours you spend to grow in the knowledge of God. As a child, you must learn to read. If you can't read, work on it for hours during the day. Grow in patience and forbearance. People will tell you not to overdo it. They're wrong. The Bible says, "Even a child is known by his doing, whether his work be pure." Don't spend your days playing all day; get to work. "Oh they need to work on their imagination!" How about let's get them to work on their wisdom? Imagination isn't half as useful as wit, intelligence, the ability to critically think about things and analyze things and work hard. We need to stop telling kids to follow their passions and start telling them to follow opportunity and take their passions with them. Reading is not going to hinder children's imaginations. It's going to open them in maturity and enlightenment. Raw imagination is not useful. It needs to be guided and refined and matured, and when kids have a hard work ethic, they will succeed. I don't think you should go to school out of expectation. You should choose it. You say, "How do you get a child to pursue a hard work ethic and study habits without coercion and pressured expectation?" Try inspiring them. There are other incentives. You can get kids fundamentally excited about the innate qualities of study. You don't have to use operant conditioning. I used to play Jump Start and Reader Rabbit and all kinds of games. I didn't even know it was for education. But I think you can get kids to make decisions that are healthy for them. Kids are not incapable of wisdom. We're just too often incapable of seeing things the way they are, the way a child can understand it, and we don't explain them well. But we can. We can labor for explanations to make our children wise. It's we who are lazy, too often. It is coercion that's lazy. Inspiring someone, building them up, making them excited, that's hard. But that is what's worth it. Kids are naturally very curious. They search for answers without your coercion. Sometimes it's best if we let them ask the questions and let them search for the answers. Kids are naturally curious, but we can desensitize them by bombarding them with our own questions that they don't care about. Education has to move in the direction of the individual. It is time for us to realize this.

When Jesus said the popular words, "It is more blessed to give than to receive," we automatically think of money, but he did not say money. Think of how easy that would be. If we just gave people $5 as we were walking buy and that would fulfil that commandment. That would be really easy. That's not what Jesus is talking about. I should say that's not all Jesus is talking about. God so loved the world that he gave his only son. So first off we see that the reason we give is because we love. That's the first observation. But imagine if God looked down from heaven and saw us helpless people who were going to have to pay for our sin, and he says, "That's tough, but here's a million dollars. Have a nice life." And we live and die and go to hell. But that's not what God did. He saw us, he knew that our problem was bigger than money, and he paid our debt with the blood of his son. That's a lot harder than just paying money. Imagine in the story Abraham when God told him to offer up his son, imagine if God gave him a choice: "give me your son, or you can redeem him with all your livestock." Do you think for one second Abraham would have walked up that mountain to offer up his son? No way. Isaac was his only son. Jesus command doesn't stop with money. When you see someone, and you walk by and say, "Here's $5, have a nice day and God bless," that is exponentially less valuable then offering them your time. What if, everyone you run into, you try to give something to them? Whether it's a word of encouragement, whether it's a compliment, whether it's asking them if you can pray for them and praying for them right there, maybe giving something financially, but the bottom line is you're living all day long as a giver. When you go through a day just trying to give, "Let me give them something," give them your attention, give them your heart, give them your ear, it's amazing how filled up you get, and how good it is to be a giver, and how it's like you've got this endless supply when you're constantly giving. It's about giving more than money. I'm not saying that all we do is say, "Be warm; be fed," and then don't actually help them out. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that most people you run into are going to benefit more from your attention and heart and ear than your pocket book. Words are more powerful than money, and so is listening. People are struggling all the time, but it's not because of a famine of produce, it's a famine of encouragement. It's a famine of joy. It's a famine of friendship. Maybe it's a famine of wisdom. Whatever it is, you always have something to give people to spur them on, and it's an endless supply. Paul said, "I wish to come to you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift (that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith)." Give more than money.

# Standards

Here's the breakdown of currency vs. money: currency goes with the currents, it constantly changes, it can be inflated. Money is based on something with intrinsic value, like gold. A dollar bill has no intrinsic value. I can't do anything with it. I can't eat it. I can't use it for anything. Gold has intrinsic value. It's worth something because it can be used for things. It doesn't rust, it outlasts everything, it equivocally indestructible. It can be used for apparel, for technology, to plate things. Gold has intrinsic value. I can always buy the same amount of food for the same amount of gold. Why? Because intrinsic value doesn't change. Perceived value changes; usefulness does not. In accounting one of the kinds of wastes is if it takes another part but doesn't add value to the customer. For some people, a phone camera is worthless, and it's a waste to add cameras to their phones because they won't use it. I think standards should somehow be based on usefulness in conjunction with Maslow's hierarchy and Hovind's time theory. Physiological needs should be the most basic. They have the most intrinsic value because they sustain human life, but because they only last a few hours at a time (Hovind's time theory), they aren't worth as much. An apple, for example, would keep me alive for only a short time. It isn't worth an apple tree. People say, "Money doesn't grow on trees." Well, in some sense, it does. Currency doesn't grow on trees, but currency doesn't have any intrinsic value. Food does, and food grows on trees. It takes labor hours to harvest the food (services), but that's another story. Things with intrinsic value are money. Things that serve as a medium of trade (a representation of intrinsic value that constantly changes as the medium is recklessly printed) is currency. So in a very real sense, it is lavishly preferable that currency does not grow on trees, but money does. Things with value grow on trees.

Now, everybody says you can't put a dollar value on human life, but I'm going to attempt to. The value of food is valuable because it keeps us alive. There are additional factors (taste (pleasure), nutrition (health), status), but for simplicity, we'll imagine the value of food is in keeping us alive. Let's say an apple will keep you alive for 6 hours. You can't make the argument, "The apple is the most valuable thing in the world because it's what keeps us alive. Physiological needs are more fundamental than the higher levels of Maslow's hierarchy, and therefore more valuable." It's true that it is more valuable to have your physiological needs met than your safety needs met, but one apple is not the essence of your physiological needs being met. If you live for 80 hears (700,800), and an apple keeps you alive for 6 hours, it would take 116,800 sustain you for your whole life. If you pay 25 cents per apple, that's $29,200 you spent to stay alive. Now let's face it, you're not going to have 4 apples a day and call it sufficient. More reasonably, let's say you spend $200 dollars per month on yourself for food and water. That's $192,000 over your lifetime to get your physiological needs met (we'll assume other needs like sleep, excretion, breathing, etc. are free. You have built in "sleeping trees" in your body that automatically grow that commodity—pretty cool). That's how much intrinsic value you are responsible to create during your life to knock out level one. That's how much your basic survival costs in America. Any person could survive for significantly cheaper. Assuming a 2,000 calorie diet, it would take 1.3 pounds of grain every day to meet that number.<sup>4</sup> But let's forget about grain. We want a well-balanced diet. You can get away with the "Monotonous Low Quality Omnivore" diet at $5.56 USD per day. But let's shoot for the best: the "Health Conscious" diet is $11.21 USD per day.<sup>5</sup> That's $327,332 over 80 years. You can get a loaf of bread for $2, some meet, vegetables, and have an average meal costing <$1. That would be $87,600. Every person should be entitled to $87,600 worth of food if they never produce anything in their lives.

Once we add up the cost of all these levels of Maslow's hierarchy we _consume_ over a lifetime, how much do we _produce_ over a lifetime? And subsequently, how much value should we be producing per labor hour (in conjunction with how many labor hours we use in a lifetime (40 years * 8 hr/day =11,680))?

# Memo

Not all labor hours excrete equal product. Services are difficult to weigh against tangible goods, making slight subjectivity inevitable. "This product can sell for this price which translates to this much gold," and once we have the product's value in gold, we will have the changing currency value. The problem with changing currency value is that to accommodate for it, you must constantly change the wages of the employee. If he produces an ounce of gold worth of product every day, and you pay him half that amount in dollars (say $500), if the price of gold doubles, $500 essentially will only buy half as much food as it would if gold maintained its currency value.

# Low Skill Workers (surrogate for high skill workers--specialization)

The underlying question behind "What do I want to do?" wasn't for me, "How much will I get paid?" but "how much am I producing?" And nobody tells you that. You never get a real sense about the value of the work that you're doing. All you get is a paycheck, and you have no idea what you're worth. That's why I didn't like network marketing, because I said, "What am I actually producing in terms of value?" I do not want to help usher in a normative form of work that doesn't create intrinsic value. I think in the future people will ask, "What is my work accomplishing in terms of intrinsic value?" You say, "That's not how human psychology works." The nice thing about human psychology is that it changes. It's capable of change. And we can do it.

What is a service worth? Well, intrinsically if you're preparing a meal for me, you did nothing to add physiological value to the raw food (in terms of nutrition, calories, etc.—survival), but you added pleasurable value. That's worth some, but it's worth less than the value of the food you're improving. Let's say you spend an hour improving the pleasure value of food for 25 people, the raw food is worth $3 on it's own, the improved pleasure value is worth 20% of its base value, making it worth $3.60, your net value being worth 60 cents per meal, multiplied by 25 people gives you $15. Now additionally, let's say these 25 people's labor hours are worth $50 per person, and from lack of specialization it takes them 30 minutes to prepare their own meal (which took you an average of 2.4 minutes because of specialization—the equipment, being ready, being trained, etc). And because you are 15 minutes closer than home, it saved them another 30 minutes in commute time, saving them a net value of 1 (labor) hour, freeing it up to do what they specialize in. Instead of wasting time driving home, preparing a meal, and driving back, they can use that hour to work (1 labor hour = $50), meaning you just saved $1,250 from being wasted by driving home, preparing a meal, and driving back. That's something that needs to be calculated in wage. It's not _intrinsic_ value, but it's something like _translated_ value. Or _redeeming_ value. You're doing something of low intrinsic value to free up the time of people who would otherwise have to waste their high labor-hour-valued time doing it. Maybe it's _preventative_ value, because you're preventing waste. The bottom line is, that translated value should be accounted for. Remember, the value of that $3 mean only increases by 60 cents, making the total hour it took each worker to drive home, prepare the meal, and drive back worth only 60 cents. That means it reduces their normal labor hour of $50 to 60 cents (or $3.60 if you include the meal raw meal). But it has to be done. Let's say you get paid 20% of the value you translated from 60 cents to $50, (or redeemed from 60 cents to $50), being $9.88. Multiplied by 25 that's $247. For one hour. That's pretty decent. But nobody is willing to pay for the translated value because nobody is thinking about it. All they think is, "meal = $13.48 for what I can make at home for $3. No." They're not thinking, "meal = $13.48, hour = $50, DIY = $3+$50, meal = $39.52 savings."

The real problem arises when you consider those 25 people are not going to have equal pay, so you can't generalize translated value. What you can do is have something like a tipping system, but based on 15% of the translated value of your hour instead of 15% of what you're buying. People say, "Well, relaxation during the drive home, a general break is worth something too." So it reduces the amount of translated value. But that can be quantified to. "How do you expect people to be honest?" You make it a cultural norm like tipping. How do you expect people to tip? Or you could replace cashiers with kiosks that necessitate a wage ID that people can have with their work badge or cell phone that validates their pay. There could be a personal cashiers for people too young to have a wage ID signature. It would have to be linked to a signature that all your jobs link to, but it's an idea. You could run experiements, have a number of places that rely on honesty and a number of places that go through the hassle, evaluate the difference (which impacts profits worse: dishonestly or deterring customers because of the hassle / extra pay?), and decide if it's worth it. But this would be a more accurate reflection and balance between created and translated value.

Business should implement 5 "redemption hours" per week, so that people have the opportunity to avoid wasting an hour on lunchbreak. Otherwise the translated value is 0 because you don't get paid for your lunch break even if you saved time driving home, preparing a meal, and driving back.

You say, "how do you begin to implement something like this in a world that's filled with preexisting systems that don't do things this way?" The same way Elon Musk got people to start using PayPal. You kick-start it with incentives until it's widely used. For one thing: make it healthy. Implement a charting system that's connected to an app tracker where you can automatically know which meals you need to fulfil you calorie / nutrition intake. Nobody does that yet, and it would certainly be one incentive. The tracker could necessitate a signature ID that's linked to all your jobs so that it guarantees you will pay the right amount for translated value. The reason people go home instead of out to eat is to be healthy. If we can provide a solution to that market, that's an incentive. We'll have a community-based franchise rulebook that decides what meals should be on the menu based on various diets (like paleo, LM). Look, this is triple-bottom-line all the way. It's healthy for people, it's healthy for the environment, and it's healthy for business. For making money.

Now it is a team effort though. You need to have someone taking orders and someone making them. How do you decide what that's worth? It's the same principle. Maybe if you have to do both jobs you can only manage 10 people. They are redeeming 15 people. Or you can rotate who does which job to even it out and be paid equally. There's all kinds of resolutions.

The team shouldn't get paid more per capita for translated value than people get paid for intrinsic value jobs.

This is quite possibly the most random idea I've become passionate about. Who thinks about this kind of thing? For real though.

Unfortunately, I think government would be necessary to implement a system of food distribution towards needy people for free, because the food needs producers, and if they aren't being paid by consumers than they will need to be paid by government. If they have multiple client / consumer bases than they might be able to afford / sustain giving away to the needy, but if they're devoted completely to the mission, they would need sustenance from government intervention or donation programs.

The principle of this is based on the following reasoning: I can spend 100 hours learning to tailor a suit to avoid the $100 cost, or I can pay a $100 cost to avoid spending 100 hours learning to do it myself, and apply those hours towards my area of specialization (each of my labor hours being $10) and earn $1000, at a $900 profit. That's specialization. We create value by becoming proficient in one thing and trading with others. I benefit. He benefits. What this does is it increases the value of our labor hours.

## Babysitting

This is the same principle of finding babysitters or nannies. Right? You're essentially saying, "My labor hours are worth more than the value of watching my kids. My labor hours are worth $50, watching my kids yield no monetary value, but I would assign a value of $10 to each hour, reducing my labor hours by $40 (or $50 in real terms). I will find someone to pay $10 per hour so that my labor hours are only reduced by $10." Really what you're doing is saying, "There is no value associated with watching kids. Zero product. Zero benefit. (Which isn't true, because you shape your children's values and character, but for the sake of simplicity). The only reason you are there is to keep them safe, and to cater to their needs should they need anything. Maybe you are there to stimulate their imagination in playing with them as well. Whatever the case is, the value of you watching them is perceived as zero. What you are doing, then, is paying someone to free you to use your labor hours in a more profitable way. You're saying, "My labor hour is worth $0 if I watch them, and $50 if I don't. I will pay you to allow me to use my labor hours at the $50 level." What is it we say? "My time is worth more than that." My labor hours can be spent in a more profitable way than watching children. But children do need to be watched. So I'll pay someone who's labor hours are worth less then $10 to watch them for me so that I can still come out with $40 per labor hour." That's babysitting.

# TV

The improvement of type 1 entertainment from a sermon to a movie is not worth the millions of dollars they spend making movies. Sermons are both entertaining and educational, and they don't waste millions of dollars to make. They cost the living cost of one man and his family for hundreds if not thousands of sermons. These sermons have debatably less value in entertainment, but unequivocally more learning value and more eternal value. In a functional, real, useful sense, one sermon is more valuable than your average movie production. These are value distortions that we need to sort out. People are dying from misdistribution of resources and intrinsically valuable goods, and we're wasting it to make movies with less value than sermons. We're stupid! We're trading intrinsic value for entertainment value, and the entertainment value we're spending it on is only a slight improvement from Francis Chan, and it's a major digression in learning value and eternal value from Francis Chan. That's not only a waste of hours, that's a waste of money! We're wasting both of them in one decision. Sermons are an improvement. Let's stop giving our money to Hollywood and Netflix so that they can waste hours of our time watching their movies and TV shows instead of watching sermons, and use that money to give to the needy and care for the widow and orphan like the Bible says. What aren't we getting?

Why are so many people fed up with religion? Because it's impure and defiled. Even God is fed up with that kind of religion, if you can believe it. The apostle James said pure and undefiled religion is this: caring for the widow and the orphan. All these atheists that think they're shaking their fists at God for the crusades, and the hypocrisy in the church, and all of the impurities and defilements of religion. God actually agrees with you there, buddy. In Malachi 3 God says, "I wish somebody would close the gates to your assemblies!" With an exclamation mark. Don't confuse God's religion with man's religion. That's a mistake. One of them is holy and righteous and good, and one of them is an abomination both to man and God.

# Wage inequality

The whole problem of wage inequality is that nobody creates a billion dollars of intrinsic value. What people at the top have done is created what I'd call innovative value (or improved value, promotion value, enhancement value, development value, advancement value), where they elevate somebody's intrinsic labor hour value from say $1 to $50, and they take 90% of the advancement value. It's like translated value, where you should not get the bulk of it, but in this case you do. Let's say your idea elevated labor hours across the board to a total advancement value of $100 billion. And you make $50 billion. You could not have in your life been responsible for creating $50 worth of intrinsic value. What you're doing is stealing the intrinsic value produced by your employees and giving them a fraction of it. That's wage inequality. I think wage inequality ought to be based on what people's labor hours are intrinsically and translationally worth. There should definitely be wage inequality, but not because of advancement value. It should be because your labor hours are intrinsically worth more or less than others.

People have ideas, they can

# Dear professor

I have this brilliant idea, but in order to address the obvious objections to it, I'd need to make it long. So I could either make it short and concise where you'll read it and say, "Well here's a problem, here's a problem, here's a problem," or I can make it long and actually talk about my resolution to those problems. Okay, how about this: I'll make it short, and if you grade it poorly by virtue of your objections, I have a chance to explain my logic personally?

# Utopia

I've long had this dream of a utopian eco-city where everything is made of glass, and it's bright, and everyone has a wake-up light, and everyone has scientifically good music, and things are based in truth and not opinions, which is why things function. Government and the word's systems used to seem so nebulous and progressive and evolved and sophisticated and civilized, but now I'm starting to view it as primitive and stupid and silly, and like concrete, extremely set and difficult to change. But I think change is possible. The reason I will not devote my life towards it is because this world is not my home. The world is nobody's destination. It's our place of journey until we come to our final place of dwelling. Our job isn't to make the bus ride as luxurious as we can. It's to drive the bus in the right direction, so that when we get to our destination, we will be in the right place. That's my passion. It's for eternity, not modernity.

## Everybody would…

Everybody would have a wake-up light, everybody would get enough sleep, everybody would eat right (maximized living), everybody would listen to healthy music, everybody would be principled, we would do education right,

# Dear God

Father, this wisdom comes to me, not from me. If they are not my words, then I will keep writing. If you keep supplying, then I will know what is the will of God. You wisdom is too much for my memory to contain. Enlarge my memory to contain more. I hear this command, "Let him who steals steal no more, but rather let him labor, that he may have something to give to one who has need." What about him that receives? What about an adult who depends on his father for sustenance? The reason I'm okay with making money from TOS is because the world has more than enough wealth to give every person an outstanding life. The world does not need me to work. It needs better distribution. Though I would create no intrinsic value in the way I make money, I would make money thusly to the end that I might labor in travail night and day before the Lord, reaping eternal harvests, freely giving as I have freely received. I don't want to keep myself from creating value. I just want to create eternal value without charging it to the saints. Partly from pride, maybe. Or partly from remembering Paul's example and discerning the will of God to follow it. If I receive money from TOS, creating zero intrinsic value (though money is like labor hours in the sense that it's value may be increased in different places, depending on where it's being used—four categories of purchases, also investment) I will still work very hard. I will not become a worthless fellow. I've given my childhood to unprincipled play, my youth to reprobate cravings. Now I give myself to God's work. Let me begin where I should have begun 20 years ago. My time of learning has yet to unfold, though I should have learned years ago. But I cheated and wasted my time. Now I will use it wisely. Learning is the process of increasing the intrinsic value, translational value, and advancement value of labor hours. I will devote myself thusly to this cause. I never knew the nebulous reasons for my learning, and so I never learned. Now I know, and I will learn. God help me. Humble me. Keep me. I devoted my commitments yesterday to the ambition of tempering all my projects with each other, that I might progress in them all. But time fails me as I keep writing the things that I receive from God. The wisdom he allows me to taste. I am glutinous because I know what is before me is not deceitful meet, but meat from the table of God. It is hard to sort through what wisdom is from within and what wisdom is from without. One is deceitful. The other is true. I have so many ambitions. I desire to complete them, to add my ideas to the world. It could change. I have the ability because God grants it. What I lack is the time, and the knowledge of God's will. How should I steward these hours? How should I steward this brain? This discipline? This strength? None of it is mine, for I was bought with a price. How does God want me to manage all of it? Though it takes time, I created the string functions in excel to fulfil my ambitions, and the Lord was gracious with me. Will he not extend his grace to whatever I do, so long as my doing is the will of the one I've delighted myself in? So it is no longer a question of his grace, whether he will grant me his victorious right hand, but a question of his will, how I may discern it. Whatever he asks, I will accomplish it. My former timidity has vanished from within me, and I know the Lord will be with me. "Am I qualified?" That's no longer my question. "Can I do it?" Not a conversation. "Is it the Lord's will?" This is the remaining variable. After God has demonstrated his faithfulness first with my father's fence, then at my brother's house, and again in my spreadsheet, and without knowing it in my collegiate career, I now have the boldness to fail. I have the boldness to believe I will know the right questions to ask. This was also with my brother Caleb, when we created his calculator. I can be an engineer. I can be a media person. All the gates that were closed are held open by my Father. What will I do? What does he will? Right now I'm accomplishing nothing, unless it be advancement value, increasing the value of my future labor. I will call it learning value. There will be a price for it. These ideas match the innovations of my day. There is no more a place for the systems of old. Words are the most valuable thing in the world, and they are a gift from God. They are free. They aren't worthless because they're free; they're provided in endless supply by a God who is infinitely wealthy. Words are the basis of every sort of complimentary value that has raised intrinsic value. Learning, translation, innovation. All of it has it's origins in words. We should be mindful of that when some make words their profession.

# Doughnut Shop

I was at a doughnut shop with my brother one morning, and as we were talking we came to the epiphany that a gallon of gas cost the same as a gallon of milk. A stranger chimed in on the conversation, "Yeah, I've thought about that before. It's like, should we be surprised that it cost $4 for oil that comes from the cow that dies and turns into oil over millions of years, or $4 for the milk that comes from the cow across the street?" His 5-7 year old child tried chiming in, to which his dad responded, "We're talking bout adult stuff." It made me chuckle a little bit, because it seemed like such a silly conversation to talk about. Who thinks about that? But what we were doing is a value comparison. It takes a lot longer to produce oil than milk, and they cost the same. That's astonishing. This man recognized the intrinsic principle that something is more valuable if it takes longer to produce. The cow dies and decomposes for millions of years until it turns into oil. Or you can just squeeze on the dangly things and out comes milk. Same value? No, but same price.

# How much do we produce?

Farmer's have the most important job, fulfilling our base physiological needs. If we had to remove all but one profession from the world, farming would be the essential remaining profession. If you lose farming, you lose all the other professions because nobody will be left alive to do them. You don't have construction because the construction workers all starved to death, or are too busy being hunter gatherers that they're labor hours are wasted doing that instead. The value of our labor hours decrease commensurately with Maslow's hierarchy, but they increase inversely with it in regards to importance. The base things must be fulfilled first. They're less valuable, but more important (maybe a value distortion). Quality of life is more important than survival. The reason people want to survive is if they love life, or fear death. It's an instinct. But it's not really worth living if you suck at it. It's not worth living if your quality of life is so bad that you wish you were dead.

So farming is the standard, I think, by which other professions should derive their value. Is your increased quality of life worth catering to before somebody else's physiological needs? From a selfless standpoint, no. If you cared about those other people, you would take care of their physiological needs before you would proceed to climb up Maslow's hierarchy. If you have a family, you're going to provide for them. Let's say you go out to eat with a certain amount of money, and you can either buy 4 portions to feed your family, or 1 quality portion and desert to feed yourself and your family would be left hungry. What would you do? You'd provide for your family. Why? Because you care about them. We know intrinsically that their physiological needs are more valuable than our excellence in Maslow's hierarchy. The reason we don't provide for people in other countries while we stuff our faces and sleep in a nice house is because we don't care about them. It just is. If they were your family, you'd give up your house before you'd let them starve. And it's fine if you don't care about them, but you need to admit that. It isn't practical for you to hang out at the first level in Maslow's hierarchy until everybody can advance with you. Or is it? To answer the practicality part of it, we're going to need to know how much value a person actually produces in their lifespan. A farmer will produce enough food for about 100 people assuming a 2,000-calorie diet on an annual basis. That's 33 million dollars over 80 years. If he works 40 years, it's half that, still 16.5 million dollars across 40 years of 8 hour work days. How much will he consume?

# Value Distortions

Things are going to be a lot easier if I separate value distortion from calculating the value of labor hours. I can calculate labor hours in terms of what he produces, and what people pay for what he produces. Calculating the real value of what he produces against a standard of usefulness, farming or gold, is going to be an enourmous task, and a futile one, because people pay for perceived value, not real value, so it won't make a difference in the world of trade. I will postpone value distortion to a seprate project, one that I may never complete. The markets decide value, and I'm going to work under the false assumption that people assign reasonably accurate value to products in the market when they pay for them. After I decipher the **market value** (opposed to intrinsic value) of products, I can do a dollar comparison between products of physiological needs and products of higher needs and evoke the question, "Is it really worth it?" Is it really worth $5 to keep this lamp on for an hour when you can pay 30 cents to keep this one on? People don't calculate what they're paying for individual things. They calculate the aggregate sum and compare it with other people to know if it's, "normal," and if it's normal, then it must be worth it. But when I had to do a project in Economics calculating the cost of living on your own, I was astonished at the high prices of utilities. "That cost $300?" "Food cost $1000 every month for our family?" When I got paid for dog sitting, it seemed an outrageously high price. "$140 for sitting around watching TV and playing with dogs for a week?" And then she explained it, "Same price as always. $20 a day." It seemed more reasonable. I spend maybe 3 hours over there, get paid $6.67 an hour for creating zero intrinsic value, but **freeing up their hours to not be wasted on it**. That should essentially be a fraction of the value they attribute to their vacation." Translation value doesn't create value, it just saves someone else from not wasting their labor hours on the thing you're doing. You're getting paid for enabling them to consume or produce something that's more valuable than what you're getting paid.

# Services

In the first section I am basing intrinsic value against the standard of market value (not truly intrinsic, but perceived—what people are willing to pay). Services means you are paying for somebody to spend their labor hours producing either consumption value (a massage), translational value (babysitting), innovative value (employing engineers to produce ideas), advancement (or learning) value (employing people to increase the value of the labor hours that belong to a specific audience—education, teaching), patent (or advancement) value (employing someone to materialize an original idea [usually to increase the value or reduce the effort of labor hours in a particular field, like tractors do in the field of agriculture]). Services, for example, you would think of as a plumber, but it can also be a team leader at Chick fil a, just with a different employer. You are being paid for your service in producing a tangible good. That tangible good has consumption value. You can also be paid for producing intangible goods like a massage, which has consumption value (pleasure, health). Babysitting is a service that produces translational value (frees you up to work). So when I say intrinsic value in this session, I'm talking about market value. Babysitting creates zero intrinsic value, because the product cannot be sold or consumed. The service is 100% translational value. A massage has zero market value (not to be confused with – you pay a market price for the service, but the service doesn't exchange anything that has market value (trade is an exchange), it exchanges something that has consumption value. It's something that you consume right away, and you can't sell it anymore. An apple has consumption value and market value. You can either eat it, applying the intrinsic consumption value towards living or pleasure, or you can sell it). Babysitting has zero market value. You are paying a market price in exchange for a service that produces either translational value, or consumption value, but not market value.
