82% of black males who are in jail come from single mother homes, so don't sit there and preach to me about how y'all do such a great job of raising kids. 

# Men have options

[No woman is special enough to degrade you](https://youtube.com/shorts/AgTbDqa_m1Y?feature=share)
She's not special bro. Get that shit out of your head. The more special you think she is the more you're going to fuck up when you're talking to her. She takes a shit in the morning like everyone else. She's a fucking human. There's girls prettier than her around. Don't be trying to hard.

# Gender roles

[Cooking is a woman's job](https://youtube.com/shorts/l7RCqMLyG0o?feature=share)

It's irrelevant if a man can cook. Just as it is irrelevant if a woman can fight.

# Toxic Masculinity

["Get on your knees" is toxic](https://youtube.com/shorts/iA_vJFgQtj4?feature=share)
There are very few things I would consider toxic masculinity, but there is nothing masculine about being selfish. A man is a king who looks after his subjects. Sex is something you have to work up to, you have to turn a woman on. Maybe the kissing was enough for her. Maybe she likes a command. In that case it's fine. But showing in on camera is the spirit of Absolom. He's such a beta that he needs to prove himself by being an exhibitionist. That's not masculine. That's needy. That's vain. It's anti-masculinity.
