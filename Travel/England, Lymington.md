# Getting Around

If you are visiting the UK from the US or Australia I recommend purchasing a [BritRail Pass](https://uktravelplanning.com/recommends/britrail-passes-with-acp-rail/ "BritRail Passes with ACP Rail") or [Global Eurail Pass](https://uktravelplanning.com/recommends/global-eurail-pass/ "Global Eurail Pass") if you are planning to use the train extensively during your trip.

BritRail Passes can only be bought _online_ up to _6 months in advance_.

If you are planning to travel to mainland Europe taking the high-speed Eurostar service from [St Pancras International](https://uktravelplanning.com/london-train-stations/) is a fast and efficient way to do this.
