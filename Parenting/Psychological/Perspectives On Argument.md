Perspectives On Argument

Argument deals with issues, ideas or topics that have not yet been settled, that invite two or more differing opinions and that are consequently subject to question, debate, or negotiation.

Whatever the issue, every argument begins with our sense of what is important to us, what matters. Maybe it resonates with a particular experience we have had in our personal life, or perhaps we find it **intellectually engaging**. For any issue, we need to begin with a very simply question: **Why do I care**?

Prerequisite to creating a coherent argument of your own is evaluating the argument you are encountering. No argument is effective if people stop listening, stop thinking, and engage in vocal fighting. "Yes, it is!" â€“ "No, it isn't!" accompanied by a fist pounding on the table gets people nowhere.

What would happen if a society were to outlaw all forms of argument? In effect, under the law, all individuals are to share the same views, and there is to be no disagreement. Argument is the necessary means to climb the latter of progress. Without any challenge to a particular view, we would still be draining people's blood out when they're sick to make them healthy. Without conflict, Nazi Germany would have annihilated the Jewish race. Argument, war, conflict, it's all a servant of growth and development.
