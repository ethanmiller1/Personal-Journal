# We will spank our children

## Biblical Reasons


## Practical Reasons

### Not spanking results in yelling
When children are not spanked, parents end up either (1) yelling at their kids as an outlet for their bad behaviors, or (2) suppressing a dislike for their children which results in relational barriers.

When a child is spanked, they know they have done wrong, and the pain is quick, and the correction is over with, and everything goes back to normal. It teaches associates the bad behavior with a consequence, and they know they learn from that.

When you yell at a child, it can cause emotional damage that can last well into their adult life. People who go to psychologists for trauma counselling often discover things they were told as a child shaped the way they think about themselves.

Example, if a 3 year old colored on dad's work papers, and excitedly shows dad, and then dad yells at the kid, "What did you do? These are my work papers!" The child learns that his contribution in the world is negative. That lodges into his mind as an insecurity and prevents him from being a proactive person later in life.

"Ethan, stay out of the way." That translates into, "Ethan, you're not helpful. Leave the important work to those that can handle it."
