Growing up I always liked to get away from my family with my friends, or call my girlfriend in a private room because I felt confined with what I could say when my family might overhear something. I didn't want to be too spiritual because it felt embarrassing, and I didn't want to be too gross because I would be "found out" or get into trouble. In my house I want everybody to be their authentic self. It's not an immunity to punishment. But by speaking freely I know a number of positive things. (1) The main reason you would hide something is because you don't want to fix it, or you're too ashamed for anyone to know so you'll try to fix it by yourself. Both of those reasons will only hurt you. So if you speak freely, I know that you aren't being sneaky trying to get away with something.
