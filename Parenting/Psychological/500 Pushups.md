Everything starts with a mindset. There is no physical fortitude, or financial fortitude without mental fortitude. Most of you are mentally weak. I have a few insults I like to use, and I throw that one around a lot. "You're weak." "What do you mean I'm weak?" "You're mentally weak." Because people are weak. And every time someone says to me, "I'm not weak," I say you are. And here's the ironclad proof, if you want to test yourself now, "Am I weak or not?"" here's the test: I want you to do 500 pushups today. One of three things is going to happen:

1. You're going to watch this video and go, "Mmm, nah." You're the weakest of all. You coward. If you're watching this, you do 500 pushups. I'm trying to fix your life. 500 pushups, how is that going to harm you in any way? It can only make your life better.
2. You're going to watch this video and say, "Yeah alright, I'm mentally strong, I'm going to do 500 pushups." And you're gong to start, and you're going to get to 47, and then stop and say, "Okay I'll do some more in an hour." And you're going to do like another 33. And you're going to get to 261 and say, "Well I tried, and that's not bad for the first day." No. I said 500. I didn't say 261. I didn't say 499. I said 500. So you're quitting too. Because you can do 500, **your body will allow you within 24 hours to complete 500 pushups, but your mind won't do it because it's hard**, so you quit like a wimp because you're mentally weak.
3. Third are the people who are going to lie. YouTube comments, "I did 500." No you didn't. Shut up. You're a liar.
4. And then 1% of you are going to watch this video and say, "You know what? Screw it, I'm going to do 500 pushups. And it's going to be hard, I'm going to want to quit, but I'm actually going to finish." If you genuinely finish these 500 pushups, than you are not a mentally weak person.

If you're watching this, and you're mentally strong, do you know what you have to do? You don't have to prove it to me, because I don't care about you. You have to prove it to yourself. If you're genuinely a mentally strong person, as soon as this video ends you're going to drop down and start these pushups.

- If you start the 500 and you quit half way through, then you're weak.
- If you never started, you're weak. 
- If you lie, you're weak.
- There's only one path to strength: that's through achievement.

Self discipline of the center of all material success. You cannot win the war against the world of you can't win the war against your own mind.
