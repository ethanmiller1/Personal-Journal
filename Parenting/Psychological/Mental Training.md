It has been well established in the psychological industry that intelligence tapers off around the age of 25, at a pace of between 3 to 7 IQ points per decade. ([Apprehension, Memory, and Fluid Intelligence Decline in Adulthood](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016402758131002)).

If someone has been in shape once in their life, they age way better. Exercise works. Cardiovascular and weight training. You start to decline in your fluid intelligence at about the age of 25. And it's a linear trend downhill and it can accelerate as you get old. #physical 

3 main contributors to intelligence:
1. Education
2. Exercise
3. Sound nutrition

There are even more findings about cognitive decline from age 70 to 76 ([Predictors of ageing-related decline across multiple cognitive functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289616302707)).

> A mistake that makes you humble is better than an achievement that makes you arrogant. ~Anonymous

I have a deep passion to setup my kids for the best possible life they can live. I don't want to make any mistakes, and I don't want to be negligent. I'm doing my best to map out all the areas of development I am responsible for nurturing, and the best strategies for stimulating growth in those areas. I guess every child wants to do things better than their own parents, and usually end up doing the exact same things, or else the exact opposite. I don't want to exist in either or those paradigms. My parents were great, they did a lot of things right, and I want to take all the good things they raised me with and build on top of it. I remember feeling somewhat neglected, and I don't want to give my kids an occasion to say that about me. So while I have a lot of passion for mental training, and giving them the best environment to foster the potential of their intelligence, I care far more that they are humble and full of grace. It would be a complete failure if I helped them achieve a great intellectual feat, and turned them into a self-centered, rotten person. What I care about isn't how smart they are, nor how beautiful they are, but how good they are. For their own sake I will diligently put them through the training to become as smart and educated as they can become. I don't care if they are above average in that area. I just don't want them to be lazy like I was, and than look at me and say it's because I neglected to provide for that area of development. Cornerwise I don't want to be a slave driver that forces them to do things they aren't interested in and give them the impression that succeeding at this is the only way to make me proud. I want the best for them. For them, not for me. It isn't that there's something I failed to do in life, and I'm living through them by making them accomplish the things I never accomplished. It's that I love them, and I'm responsible for them, and I'm doing everything I can to provide for them. They need to know that. They need to be properly motivated by the benefits of education and intelligence, not by a chip on their shoulder to prove something to their dad or to themselves. That would mess everything up. They won't learn as effectively, their heart won't be in it for the right reasons, and after they spend years of their life brainlessly doing what they're told, they will question why they ever began in the first place. #parentingmotivation
