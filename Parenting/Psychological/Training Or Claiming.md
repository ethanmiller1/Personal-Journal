Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it. ([Proverbs 22:6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+22%3A6&version=ESV))

And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. (Deuteronomy 6:6-7)

"You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. (Deuteronomy 11:18-19)

 "Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. Make them known to your children and your children's children— (Deuteronomy 4:9)

Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him. ([Proverbs 22:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+22%3A15&version=ESV))

Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him. ([Proverbs 13:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+13%3A24&version=ESV))

Discipline your son, for there is hope; do not set your heart on putting him to death. ([Proverbs 19:18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+19%3A18&version=ESV))

... from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. ([2 Timothy 3:14-15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A14-15&version=ESV))

Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with a rod, he will not die. If you strike him with the rod, you will save his soul from Sheol. ([Proverbs 23:13-14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+23%3A13-14&version=ESV))

Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near of which you will say, "I have no pleasure in them"; ([Ecclesiastes 12:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+12%3A1&version=ESV))

"To whom will he teach knowledge, and to whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, those taken from the breast? For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little." ([Isaiah 28:9-10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+28%3A9-10&version=ESV))

All your children shall be taught by the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children. ([Isaiah 54:13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+54%3A13&version=ESV))

I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old, things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might, and the wonders that he has done. (Psalm 78:2-4)

Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father; and he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a boy, he began to seek the God of David his father, and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, and the carved and the metal images. (2 Chronicles 34:1-3)

## Righteousness:

But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— 22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. 26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

27 Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. 28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. 29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 30 since God is one—who will justify the circumcised by faith andthe uncircumcised through faith. 31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, weuphold the law. (Romans 3:21-3)

And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness. (Genesis 15:6)

What then shall we say was gained by[[a](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4&version=ESV#fen-ESV-28008a "See footnote a")] Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness." 4 Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. 5 And to the one who does not work but believes in[[b](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+4&version=ESV#fen-ESV-28012b "See footnote b")] him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, 6 just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: "Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin." (Romans 4:1-8)

That is why his faith was "counted to him as righteousness." 23 But the words "it was counted to him" were not written for his sake alone, 24 but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, 25 who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification. (Romans 4:22-25)

Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? (Galatians 3:2)

Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify[[c](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3&version=ESV#fen-ESV-29094c "See footnote c")] the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you shall all the nations be blessed." 9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. (Galatians 3:7-9)

Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent." (John 6:29)

And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, 10 so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. (Philippians 1:9-11)

For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. ([Romans 10:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A4&version=ESV))

Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. ([James 3:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+3%3A1&version=ESV))
