# How do I want to be remembered?

People who don't know where they are headed on the journey of life always find themselves walking in circles without making any progress. Such people go from one pointless activity to the other.

Your Life Plan is essentially the result of answering three powerful questions:
• How do I want to be remembered?
• What matters most?
• How can I get to where I want to be from here?
​
​
A Life Plan will also help you carve out a brighter future by helping you build habits that will make you a high achiever.

## Write your eulogy
​
One way to catch a glimpse of the kind of legacy you'll leave behind is to write your eulogy as if it were being read today. ~ Michael Hyatt, Daniel Harkavy
​
During your funeral, someone from your family and friends will offer a eulogy, a "good word" about your life. Imagine you could attend your own funeral and listen to those conversations.
​
### Create short stories - what will be meaningful?

The best way to write your eulogy and make it as real as possible is to create a series of short stories of who you want the important people in your life to remember you. These stores are your Legacy Statements, and you can write them in three simple steps.
​
Start by making a list of the relationships that are most important to you. Who will be in attendance at your funeral? You don't have to state each person's name. Just list the groups under which they fall, such as family, friends, and work associates.
​
Once you're done, write down how you want these people with whom you shared different meaningful connections to remember you. What impression do you want to leave on them forever?

Lastly, make your Legacy Statements highly compelling and convincing. They should be so specific that they will engage your mind and your heart while writing them. These statements, put together, will help you frame your eulogy.

## Life Accounts
​
Your Life Accounts are all the different sections that make up your life. This ranges <mark class="hltr-yellow">from career to family, to self-care, to finances, to friends</mark>. Your list can have as many accounts as you want.
​
Once you have your list of Life Accounts, you can then go ahead to evaluate how you fare in each. Your Life Accounts work just like bank accounts. Each has a specific balance. Some are growing, some are holding steady, and some are declining. So take a look at your accounts and see how well you've managed each of them.
​
By arranging your life accounts in order of their importance, you won't make the mistake of prioritizing trivial things over essential ones.

# How will I spend my 30,000 days?
​
A lifetime seems like a long period of time, but in reality, it's not. A regular American citizen has an average lifetime of around 30,000 days. It sounds a lot of time but think about how quickly a year goes by, and you'll soon realize how little time you have. With that in mind, how you decide to spend your days is a decision that you need to think about carefully. However, don't think too long, as you're wasting precious time!
​
Far too many people allow their life to pass them by. As depressing as it may seem, before you know it, you're on your deathbed, and you're lamenting missed chances and opportunities.
​
The most successful people have learned how to manage their time more smartly, so they're not working every hour of the day. Learn to say "no" when you either don't have the time or you don't want to do something. Of course, you can't say "no" to everything that comes your way, but if the situation is suitable, it's completely permissible to politely decline to do something that doesn't fit in with the rest of your day's plan.
​
Worry is a total waste of time and energy, and it stops you from doing the things you really want to do. As a result, you're very unlikely to achieve much at all.
​
Imagine that you have two buckets — the first is a bucket of things you can do something about, and the second is a bucket of things you can do nothing about. There is no point worrying about the second bucket; if you can't do anything about it, you simply have to let it be and have faith that all will work out. The first bucket is where you need to focus your attention. Too many people focus on the second bucket and spend endless amounts of time worrying. Let it go!
​
Focus on building your character rather than a reputation; reputations can change over time, but character is a firm foundation. ~ Peter Atkins
​
Peter Atkins lives his life by 4 principles: 
• Whatever you think is right, do it 
• Don't follow the lead of others 
• Keep your word and always be as honest as possible 
• Always admit when you're wrong
​
Living by these principles means you're living an honest and authentic life which will allow you to meet other like-minded people. These are your real friends.

# Everyone Is Busy

It's easy to believe people in [the No Action] group aren't expending energy and other resources, but this is not so. Every action group is busy channeling their time, money, and potential into something. The No Action group is the habit of devoting themselves into things that won't matter in the long run.
​
There's no such thing as unrealistic goals for the extraordinary person — there only exist goals that require massive amounts of action compared to others.
