I'm perfectly happy with the idea that I stand apart from the majority of Christian thought. What's popular has never been the standard by which the Bible instructs us to measure our understanding. In fact, it's more likely that if what you believe is popular, it is not correct. The way is narrow that leadeth to life. Now that verse is talking about salvation, how Jesus is the only way to the Father, but it does seem to be analogous to how the rest of the Bible construes correct doctrine. Jesus said you will be hated on account of me. Paul said false teachers would wax worse and worse. There are all kinds of warnings about falling into the trap of surface level teachings, and earl tickling's, and the crafty cunningness whereby many lie in wait to deceive. So the question of whether it's c commonly held view does not affect whether it's true or not. (And inversely, of course, the fact that you are isolated in your belief does not indicate you are correct either. There are many false ways, and one correct way. And few may find it, but few is still comprised of multiple, not pioneering lone ranger's whoa re the only people who know what God "really means")
