In John 15 Jesus tells a story about a vine and its branches. Now the vine had two types of branches: branches that abode in the vine and branches that did not abide in the vine. The branch that was in the vine bore fruit, and the branch that was apart from the vine could do nothing. He explains the parable saying that He is the vine and we are the branches. He actually said "abide in Me and I in you." Why? Why not just be a non abiding non fruit bearing vine? Cause, let's be honest, life is busy. A person's gotta work and create things, and then he comes home and has to spend the rest of his day busy doing household projects and other miscellaneous things for people, and if he's lucky enough he might have some time to relax or sleep. Who's got time to abide in Jesus and bear fruit? Who has time? And I think a lot of us know, if we're honest, the harvest of fruit in our lives is not bountiful. I mean, none of us dislike the idea of producing the fruit that comes from the Holy Spirit indwelling your heart. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control; these aren't unattractive things. But maybe you've been so caught up in the business that your harvest just isn't bountiful this year. Maybe you've been a little unloving, a little stressed, a little restless, it couldn't be the fruit of the spirit because Jesus said that apart from me you can do nothing. Atheist can be patient. In fact, Sunday is the worst for fast food workers because Christians are so impatient. That's a sad reality. It can't be works or converts. It has to be the good stored up in a man's heart; his doctrine, what he believes.

When I was younger being homeschooled by my mother, I remember one semester that we incorporated a book about heaven into our daily reading. My mom loved those sorts of books, and it always managed to calm her spirit, evident in the peace of her voice with the words of prayer afterward. A few years later, a movie came out about another book, "Heaven Is For Real," and in it somebody said, "If heaven is for real, we would live our lives radically different, wouldn't we?" Maybe we would trust in God instead of the physician like king Asa. It's clear that atheists don't live according to the philosophy that their worldview demands,  but on the flip side neither do we

Being a *insert word* doesn't mean encouraging them only when they've done something right, it's better to encourage them *to* do something right.

Revelation 3: Are these words we normally use for a believer? I once was blind but now I blind? If you get it, you won't be lukewarm. There is this broad, lukewarm path that leads to destruction, but a few will travel the narrow path that leads to life.















 
Notes:
	There is no compromise; either you give up everything to gain Christ, or you hold on to the ice cubes of your natural self. There is no holding on to your favorite TV series that is not good or useful, there is no holding on to your favorite fantasy that elevates yourself from who you are to who you like to imagine you are, there is no holding on to your favorite Christian song that you sing on an imaginary stage with all the girls you know in the audience lusting for you, there is no holding on to the person you are when nobody is around, there is no holding on to the characteristics that you don't let anybody see because you're embarrassed about them, there is no holding on to the evil that runs through your mind because no one can hear it, there is no holding on to the sleep that you go to bed for when you haven't nourished yourself with the Word that you live by, - 
White washed tombs. 
Lukewarm Christianity. What is hot Christianity? 
It's not your habits you need to change, it's your heart that needs to change.
The whole body must exercise for one member to benefit.
God is not glorified in us when we have no joy in Him. Of course David puts a special focus of joy in his prayer of repentance, God doesn't look at that and say, "Selfish! Selfish!" That magnifies Him.
The greatest obstacles a Christian encounters are not extrinsic. His battle is neck up.
Guard your heart with all diligence, for out of it flows the spring of life. Or do you not know that whoever commits sin is a slave to it? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or a slave to obedience, which leads to life. Why choose death?
If you had any conception of shame, it would pervade you.






















 
	As a bird who is stripped of her song, joy does not proceed from my mouth. In my storehouse of words, I have required a lament. The upright man guards himself from wickedness; all day long he is careful with the desires of his heart, but in only a moment his righteousness shatters as a fallen glass.
	The moment of temptation is an epiphany, as the snare of sin testifies that the source of captivity is not militantly weighed by your victory against your defeats. Slavery does not depend on how hard one fights against the heart. For a sinking ship that is filling with water is not saved as the crew jettison's the water out one bucket at a time; rather, they must repair the leaks in the ship. Ill health is not cures by treating the symptoms; it is the disease which must be treated. And the disease of the heart is not cured by resisting your sinful desires; the devil will flea, but shortly return, just as congestion is not cures by blowing your nose. Blowing the nose may be necessary to breathe while congested, but it isn't sufficient to remedy congestion. You must go beyond what gives you immediate relief, to the little things that make you well. The congested man must abstain from milk until he is on his feet; perhaps even good things maintain the bad in a time of sickness: friends, television, fantasies, computers, music, writing, social media, religion, school, work, busy everyday life, whatever it is that you need to cut out of your life to make you well again. Victory in the battle doesn't change a man's heart, but hope is not dead. People change. Hearts change. Desires change. When a person chooses to eat what is healthy, eventually he comes to despise the unhealthy things he used to crave.
	Raise a lament for the man who sets his gaze on the deleterious menu, for the man that feeds his body unwisely is the same man who feeds his heart with corruption. It isn't a man's striving that determines victory over that which he aims to obtain, it's his philosophy which determines his whole life; his principles that seep into his every decision. Wisdom will guide a man, and his statutes will watch over him, but throughout the whole body. The belly will not lose weight with many sit-ups, and spot reduction is a lie. A man must exercise his while body for one member to benefit. For good health in one member is achieved in all members alike, and every time energy is demanded for the body, each member contributes their fat the same.

Scripture:
There is a way which seems right to a man,
But its end is the way of death (NASB Proverbs 14:12).

in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. (NASB Ephesians 2:2)

"You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart" (Jeremiah 29:13). The point is this that no one will stumble into the kingdom or wander through the narrow gate by accident. Someone asked Jesus, "Lord, will those who are saved be few?" He replied, "Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able" (Luke 13:23–24).

"If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it" (Luke 9:23–24).

"If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin."
(1 John 1:6-7 ESV)
"I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me."
(Proverbs 8:17 ESV)
"Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation."
(Psalm 142:5, 143:5 ESV)
