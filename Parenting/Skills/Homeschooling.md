The primary purpose of learning is to increase the value of your labor hour (see "Absolute Value of Labor Hours" paper). As such I will focus on a more practical curriculum wherein my children will gain skills and practical knowledge as opposed to irrelevant facts that have no application for their futures. #parentingmotivation 

# Public School

If we homeschool the kids, our challenge will be taking care of their social lives. If we public school our kids, the challenge will be taking care of their spiritual lives. It's easier to teach someone than to un-teach them.

## Daily Devotions

In order to offset the inevitable value systems that will be presented to our children by (1) teachers with alternative worldviews in the Public School System, and (2) their friends who posses worldly desires untethered from biblical principles, we will do careful diligence to spend time with our kids and understand the way their thinking is being influenced by external sources.

This effort is maybe a good thing anyway, because it will force us not to be lazy in teaching our kids diligently and making sure they know what they stand on.
