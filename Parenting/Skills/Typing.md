With today's increasing technologically oriented age, we believe being a typist is one of the biggest advantages our children can have. Hot Keys and fast typing, keeping your fingers on Home Row will enable them to perform efficiently both on the job and be impressive in interviews. I was impressed with Dustin Le when I interviewed him because of his typing, and Brandon Benham is a wizard with programming because of his typing abilities. Tim Rayburn says if you can go all day without touching a mouse, that's a good thing. All the best programmers have this attribute in common. It's more important than cursive. #parentingmotivation
