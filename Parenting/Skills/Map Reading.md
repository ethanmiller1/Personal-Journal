I always said I have a mad sense of direction, but I realize that I've been using that as an excuse to be mentally lazy and avoid the work of paying attention to markers around me and lining it up with the map to find out where I am and how to orient the map. I believe map reading is a skill, not a sense. And if it can be learned, it will be useful with soul-winning, traveling, vacation, and more. The person who knows where to go is the leader, so become good at map reading.
