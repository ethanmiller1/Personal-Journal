The last time I learned how to read was the first time I learned how to read. And that's a problem because when you first learn how to read, you're learning to read very basic material (Dr. Seuss, The Cat In The Hat, etc).

1. Improve your focus by using your hand (or a pen) as a guide, moving from left to right (20%-30% faster). For online material, use [AccelaReader](http://accelareader.com/) as your pacer.
	
2. The deadline strategy: Measure how long it takes to read 1 page, then try to beat that time.
	
3. Look at figures as they are referenced, not afterwards.
	
4. Notetaking is like interrupting the author, but it is a form of repetition (like learning the lyrics to a song by hearing it over and over). (1) Read a paragraph, (2) Take a quick note (a keyword or phrase), (3) Repeat. This is to get you mind in the mindset of, "What did I just read?"
	
5. Abstract vs. Visual, "The Baker / Baker Paradox." 90% of group A could not remember Mr. Baker's name. Most people in group B could remember that he was a baker (baked for a living.) Use similar sound technique.
	
6. The "25-5" Strategy: Read for 20 minutes, Break for 5 Minutes (or take notes)
