# Questions of Evangelism

* Do you think you're a good person?
* Have you been born again?
* Are you living in holiness?
* Do you read your Bible?
* What do you think happens when someone dies? Where do they go?
* Mow many lies have you told in your life? What do you call someone who tells lies?
* Have you every stolen something? What do you call someone who steels things?
* Have you ever used God's name in vain? God gave you life, eyes to see his creation, taste buds to enjoy good food, ears to enjoy good music, and lavished his goodness on you, and you used His name to express disgust; that's a very serious crime before God.
* Have you ever lusted for a woman? Jesus said you commit adultery in your heart when you do that.
* By your own admission, you're a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer and murderer at heart. If God judges you by the Ten Commandments on the Day of Judgement where would you go?
* Do you believe in evolution? Do you believe God created everything?
* Do you think there's a heaven? Do you think you're going there? / Let me ask you a few questions to see where you're going, okay?
* Would a judge let a man go who's raped a woman and slit her throat jus because he says, "Judge, I've got to admit, I did wrong. I feel bad about that"? Being sorry for your sins isn't going to exonerate you on the Day of Judgement.
* How can you justify yourself of the Day of Judgment?
* Did you know Jesus said in Matthew 7:21 that many will come to Him and say "Lord, Lord! Look at all of this stuff we did for you! Look at all of our works!" And He will say, "Depart from me, I never knew you. All of your good works weren't good enough." When you sin, you offence is against He whose dignity is infinite. When you transgress that infinite dignity, the payment is also infinite. Can you make up for an infinitely horrible crime (think of Adolf Hitler killing 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, against man, that crime wasn't infinite, against God, lying is an infinite crime) by going some good things in your life? There problem is that they trusted in themselves for salvation on the Day of Judgment, but Jesus says, "No, he who trusts in himself will perish."
* How do I find everlasting life? If I said to you, I'm afraid of dying, what would you tell me?
* Do you know what you've just done? You've broken the first and the second of the Ten Commandments. The second commandment says "Don't make for yourself a graven image, don't make a God to suit yourself, either with your hands or with your mind," There is only one God, and He's perfect and Holy and He's righteous. . . . That's called idolatry. The first commandment says you shall have no other gods before me.
* Now can I ask you about your spiritual beliefs, would that offend you? Can you handle that?
* What do you think happens after someone dies? Do you think there's an after life? / are you an atheist?
* You don't believe in a Hell? So what's going to happen to Hitler? He killed 6 million Jews plus gypsies and blacks.
* Do you believe in a right and a wrong?
* Do you believe in God's existence? Do you believe in Heaven? Do you think you'll go there? Are you a good person? You know there's a test you can do to see if your going to heaven. We'll do that quick test. / This is your eternity. This is more important than who you'll marry, more important than your vocation, your education.
* Do you believe in God? Do you believe the Bible is true? Do you believe God spoke through the Bible, that it's words are divine? Does God break promises? The Bible says. . . So when the Bible tells us the souls that sins will die, is it true? Do you believe Jesus is the son of God? Do Jesus said that many will come to him thinking they knew him but on judgment day will be cast into the lake of fire. How would someone know that they really do know God, and aren't going to be one of those people?
* After the divorce, what happened? You just stopped going to church, or did you disaffirm your belief on Jesus? Divorce is one of my big no no's, because implicitly it sends the message that God is ready to leave you at any time. All kinds of invisible mentality creep into the children of divorced patents. "my love isn't enough to keep people together." "I'm not enough." Divorce distorts a child's view of God. And therefore they often fall away.
* Do you believe the Bible?
* Do you believe that 2,000 years ago there was a man named Jesus?

# Apologetics: Intelligent Atheist vs Muslim.

I'm saying that humans being alive is no evidence that things couldn't have been different. (Fine Tuning). It assumes that humans are the only sentient creature in the vastness of the universe.

There's no reason to think that life is the point of the universe. (So we're just a happy coincidence?)

You wouldn't put your life on it? So why would you put your afterlife on it?

When you throw the stack of letters, it's going to land in an order, and each one of those orders is as improbable as the others, but it did land in one of them. (But only one of them is coherent?) The probability of any result was as tiny as this result.

Could that first entity not have been the universe? (It could have been if it was past eternal, but because the universe had a beginning, it couldn't have existed forever. Do you see what I'm saying?)

I do my best thinking when I'm alone. I cantalk about things I've already thought about in a group, but as far as thinking things through, can't do that.

"I don't believe in God." Well it's okay; He believes in you. The Bible says to as many as receive him, they are given the right to become children of God. That's a right I strongly recommend you exercise. All you've got to do is receive Him. That's what the Bible says. Listen, we're getting real now. All that stuff we were talking about earlier was just silliness, but this thing is serious. Do you know what foolishness is? It's caring a lot about things that matter little, and caring little for things that matter a lot. Eternity matters a lot. You either spend it is heaven or hell. You say, "Why does God send people to hell?" I want you to understand something. God has done everything He could to save you from hell. \[Because God is good He must punish our sins, or else He isn't just. Jesus came down and bore our sins on the cross, descended into hell for 3 days and 3 nights, and on that 3rd morning He rose out from hell, eternally triumphant over all His enemies so that there is now no condemnation for all who believe.\] All that is left now is for you to say, "Yes God, I receive your gift of salvation." Listen, if you don't know Jesus, I need you up here right now.
