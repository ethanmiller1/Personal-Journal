# 5 Premises of Living Faith

For a lost person to be saved they MUST believe:

1.  That they are a sinner (Romans 3:23)
2.  That the punishment for their sin is hell (Romans 6:23a & Revelation 21:8)
3.  That salvation was paid for in full by Jesus Christ (Romans 5:8)
4.  That eternal life is a free gift (Romans 6:23b, Ephesians 2:8-9, Titus 1:2)
5.  In eternal security of the believer (1 John 5:10-11)

# Script

**Introduction**: Hi, how you doing? Pastor Steven Anderson, just wanted to invite you to Faithful Word Baptist church. Do you go to church anywhere?

**Examine**: Well listen, more important than going to church, if you were to die today, are you 100% sure that you're going to heaven?

**Invitation**: Okay. Well, could I just take a couple minutes and show you how you can know that 100% for sure?

**5 Points of the Gospel**: The Bible says right here in Romans 3:23, it says:

> [!Bible] 
> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
> 
> 
  [Romans 3:23 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+3:23?translation=kjv)


So we all have sinned. I've sinned, you've sinned, and not only that, but the Bible says we come short. So do we measure up to what God expects? No, we come short.

Well, there's a punishment for our sin, the Bible says right here in Romans 6:23, it says:

> [!Bible] 
> For the wages of sin is death;
> 
  [Romans 6:23 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+6:23?translation=kjv)


So what's God's punishment for our sin? Well look, after we die though, that's not the end. After we die, there's what the Bible talks about, the second death. I'm going to show you that right here in Revelation 20:14

> [!Bible] 
> And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
> 
> 
  [Revelation 20:14 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Revelation+20:14?translation=kjv)


So after you die, there's a second death, of going to a place called hell, which is the lake of fire, where you're basically punished and tormented for your sin. I mean, you have to pay for all the sins that you've done in your whole life. Verse 15:

> [!Bible] 
> And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
> 
> 
  [Revelation 20:15 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Revelation+20:15?translation=kjv)


Then right over here it says that all liars—now have you ever told a lie before? Everybody has. I mean, every single person. But it says there in chapter number 21 and verse 8:

> [!Bible] 
> all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
> 
> 
  [Revelation 21:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Revelation+21:8?translation=kjv)


And it lists all these other sins, but then it says even all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death. So according to this verse, where are all liars going? Okay but look, God loves us, right? Do you think, if God loves us, does he want us to go to hell? No. So because God loves us—but do you think he just said that and he didn't mean it? I mean, obviously if it's in the Bible, he meant that. That's the punishment that we deserve for our sins. But because God loves us, he doesn't want us to have to pay that punishment, so here's what God did for us, it says in Romans 5:8,

> [!Bible] 
> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
> 
> 
  [Romans 5:8 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+5:8?translation=kjv)


Okay, so what that basically is talking about, God himself became a human being, (Jesus Christ, you know, he was born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, never sinned, he lived the perfect life none of us could live, and of course you know the story. They lied about him, they arrested him, they beat him, they spit on him, nailed him to the cross, okay? Well when he was nailed to the cross, the Bible says,

> [!Bible] 
> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree
> 
> 
  [1 Peter 2:24 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Peter+2:24?translation=kjv)


So what it means when it says he bare our sins in his own body, every sin you've ever done in your whole life, every sin I've ever done, when Jesus was on that cross, it was as if he had done it. And so he was being punished for murder, for stealing, for lying, all the sins that we and everyone else in the whole world committed, he never sinned, but he bore our sins in his own body. When he died on the cross, he was being punished for our sins. They took his body, they buried it in a tomb, his soul went down to hell for 3 days and 3 nights, he was punished for our sins. What happened 3 days later? He rose again from the dead. Exactly.

So, now look, do you believe that Jesus died for everybody? Okay, well, you're right, because the Bible says that he died

not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. (1 John 2:2)

But do you think everybody is going to heaven though? Probably not, right? Well look, I'm going to show you what the difference is, because obviously everybody is not going to heaven, what is it that determines who goes and who doesn't? I'm going to show you right now. It says right here in Acts 16:30,

> [!Bible] 
> And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
> 
> 
  [Acts 16:30 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Acts+16:30?translation=kjv)


Pretty good question right?

> [!Bible] 
> And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
> 
> 
  [Acts 16:31 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Acts+16:31?translation=kjv)


Now what does that say you have to do in order to be saved? Does that say that you have to go to church? Does it say that you have to be baptized? Does it say that you have to give up any of your sins, or be willing to give up sin? Turn your life around? Anything like that? What does it say that you have to do? Believe. Just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. Now look, I'm going to show you the most famous verse in the whole Bible. John 3:16, the Bible says right here,

> [!Bible] 
> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
> 
> 
  [John 3:16 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+3:16?translation=kjv)


And then look at verse 18,

> [!Bible] 
> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
> 
> 
  [John 3:18 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+3:18?translation=kjv)


Now look, we can see just from those 3 verses (I mean, I could show you hundreds), but the point is that it says that everyone who believes on Jesus Christ will be saved. I mean, it says here that whosoever believeth, he that believeth is not condemned. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. Now does that say whosoever is good enough? Whosoever lives a good life? Joins a good church? No, whosoever believeth in him. Okay? Well let me show you one more verse, but did you notice how it said, "believe **on**"? He that believeth on him is not condemned? And it said in Acts 16:31, believe **on** the Lord Jesus Christ? The reason—we would normally think of believe **in**. Believe in would be, "Well I believe that Jesus is real, died on the Cross," and so forth. When you say you believe on him, that means you're putting your faith on him to get you to heaven. You don't think that you're going to heaven because of anything that you're doing, (you're a sinner, you come short), you're putting your faith on him to save you. But I'm going to show you one last verse that kind of ties the whole thing together. This will kind of wrap up the whole thing. It says right here,

> [!Bible] 
> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
> 
  [Romans 6:23 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+6:23?translation=kjv)


Now is a gift something you have to ear, or is it free? Exactly. Now look, who pays for the gift? The giver, or the receiver? The person giving the gift. Who's giving us eternal life? So who's got to pay for it? He already paid for it, when he shed his blood on the cross, Jesus Christ paid for our salvation. He paid for our eternal life.

If I were to give you a gift—and what's your name by the way? If I said, "Dave, I'm going to give you this Bible as a gift, but I need you to give me $5," is that a gift? Okay, what if I said, "Okay Dave, I'm going to give it to you for free, but I'm going to need you to wash my car"? It's still not a gift. If you've got to do any work for it, it's not a gift. But what if I said, "I'm giving this to you for free. Just take it." Now look, who does that Bible belong to now that I gave it to you? It's yours now. Now can I come back any time I want and just take it from you? What if I come back like a few months from now, and you've done something wrong to me, could I just come in your house and just take this away? No, that would make me what? A thief. And a liar. Well look, the Bible says right here that God has given to us eternal life, (it says in 1 John 5:10 actually),

> [!Bible] 
> He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
> 
> 
  [1 John 5:10 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1John+5:10?translation=kjv)


Now if God gave it to us, then it belongs to us. He's not going to take it away from you. What I'm trying to say is you can't lose your salvation. I mean, once you're saved, it's eternal life. Okay. It lasts for—do you know what eternal means? Forever. So if you get it and it lasts forever, how many times do you think you have to get that? One time. Could you ever lose it? I mean, think about it. If I said, "Dave, I'm going to give you this Bible forever," and then I took it back for any reason, was I telling the truth when I said that I was giving it to you forever? No. If I say I'm giving it to you forever, that'll last forever. So God is given to us eternal life, that's going to last forever. You can't lose it. Jesus said it this way, "I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee." So no matter if you've quit church, even if you did something awful, like kill somebody, or even kill yourself, God will not take away your salvation. Because look, you weren't good enough to get saved anyway. We come short. We're sinners. The only reason that we're going to heaven is through the blood of Jesus. And so, you can't be good enough to get saved, you don't have to be good to stay saved. I mean, it's by grace through faith. So once you're saved, you're always saved. It's eternal life, it's a gift. Okay? And as soon as God took it back he's a liar. And God, the Bible says,

> [!Bible] 
> In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
> 
> 
  [Titus 1:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Titus+1:2?translation=kjv)


So you can't lose it. So let me ask you this, Dave, do you believe you've sinned? Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross for your sins? And you believe he rose again from the dead? Now, according to what I just showed you in the Bible right here, if you were to ask Jesus to save you right now, would he do it? And how long would you be saved for? What if you do something terrible? It's eternal. It's a gift. So look, what I want to do, Dave, you said you believe that if you were to pray and ask Jesus to save you right now, he'd do it and you'd be saved forever, I want to help you pray that right now, okay? I just want to help you tell God that that's what you believe so that you'll know that you're going o heaven. You can just ask to be saved right now. Let's bow our heads right now, you can just repeat this after me, and pray this to God. Go ahead and bow your head and just pray this with me.

## Sinner's Prayer

>Dear Jesus,
>I know I'm a sinner,
>I know I deserve to God to hell,
>but I believe that you died on the cross for me,
>and rose again,
>please save me right now,
>and give me eternal life,
>I'm only trusting you, Jesus,
>Amen.

## Closing Statements

Alright, you meant that right? That's all in the world the Bible says you have to do to be saved. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Now let me ask you this. Do you have a Bible?

1.)  In eternal security of the believer (1 John 5:10-11)

# Script: Diamante

**Introduction**: How's it going? I'm from Friendship Baptist church. I just wanted to invite you to church. Do you go to church around here? Awesome.

**Examine**: More important than going to church, if you were to die today, are you 100% sure that you're going to heaven? So you'd say like 50/50? Yeah, I hear that.

**Invitation**: The Bible makes it really clear how we can know 100% that if you die today you're going to heaven, and it's real simple. It's not based on how good you are. It's all where you place your faith. If you have 5 minutes I can show you real quick.

**5 Points of the Gospel**: So first and foremost, what's your stance on the Bible? Do you believe the Bible is the word of God? Awesome—so whatever this says, you believe? So the Bible says in Romans 3:23,

For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

So we all have sinned. We all come short of God's perfection. That's a given, right? Well because we've sinned, the Bible says:

For the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23)

So because we sin, we die. Everyone on this earth will die one day. That's because everyone has sinned. Right? We've all done stuff that's wrong. When you die your body goes into the ground, but your spirit lives on, and it can go to heaven or hell. The Bible makes that distinction in Revelation 20:14,

And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

So your first death, again, is physical death. That's my body. Your second death is spiritual. It says right here,

all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. (Revelation 21:8)

That says all liars are going to the lake of fire. Now have you ever lied before? If I lied to you once, what would you call me? If I murdered one person, that would make me a murderer. It only takes one to earn the title. So if you died today as a liar, where does the Bible say you'd go? Now do you think that God wants to send you to hell? No, because he loves you. He loves you so much, it says in Romans 5:8,

But God commendeth [or expresses] his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

So Jesus Christ came down from heaven; God became man. Jesus Christ was God. Do you believe that? He lived a sinless life, never sinned once, he died on the cross for our sins, for the sins of the whole world, he was buried and then 3 days later he rose again from the dead. Now Jesus Christ died for everyone, but do you think that everyone's going to heaven? No, because there's something that we must do. The Bible is very clear what we must do. In Acts 16:30 is says,

And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

Now notice that: they ask what _must_ I do. Now there's things we should do. Should you go to church? Yes. Should you read the Bible? Yes. Should you preach the gospel? Yes. But what must you do to be saved from the lake of fire? From your sins? Look what they said:

And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.

Now what does that say you have to be baptized to be saved? Does that say go to church? It just said believe. And notice how it says "on" right there. It says believe _on_ the Lord Jesus Christ. So if this is Jesus [hold out your hand] and this is your faith [hold out your Bible], your faith has to be on Jesus [put Bible on hand]. That means it's resting wholly on what he did for you. Now if you asked me if I was going to heaven and I told you, "Yes," because I'm a good person, I go to church, I read the Bible, is my faith on Jesus Christ or is my faith on myself? It's faith on myself, right? And that's not what the Bible said I had to do. It said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Now I don't doubt you believe in Jesus, but is your faith totally on Jesus if you're trusting in something that you're doing? No. The Bible is clear. I'll just reiterate that with two more points. The Bible says right here:

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.

So the Bible is very clear. It's not of works. It's not based upon how good you are. God calls salvation a gift. A gift is inherently free. If I offered you this book as a gift, but then I said, "You have to wash my car," is that a gift? No, because you're working for it. A gift is free. All you have to do to receive he gift of salvation is believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. And once you receive that gift, God makes it very clear that it's everlasting. The Bible says:

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever [and that includes you] believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (Ephesians 2:8-9)

Now how long does everlasting last? Forever. Yeah. So if you got saved today, okay, you put all your faith on Jesus, would you be saved twenty years from now? Of course, because it's everlasting. Let's say you get saved today and then twenty years from now you commit murder. And God takes that gift back. He says, "Okay, you're not saved anymore." Was that everlasting? No. God says it's everlasting. That means once you're saved, you're saved forever, no matter what. Now people will say, "Well, can I just do anything I want? And still go to heaven?" You could, because it's not based upon how good you are. That doesn't mean there's not going to be consequences for our sins. Now you have a father. The Bible says in John 1:12:

But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:

God states that once we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, God becomes our Father. Now who do you think is a better father? Your dad, or God? God. So, is there anything you could do to change the fact that your father on this earth is your father? Say you never talk to him though, is he still your father? What if you move to Africa. Is he still your father? Well what if you murder someone. Is he still your dad? Of course. And you just said, "God's a greater father than our fathers." Right? How much more faithful would he be? How much more would he love us? He'll never forsake us. He'll never leave us. Right? So once we establish that relationship, of Father-son, that can never be broken. So once you're saved, you're saved forever. And when I first asked you, you said, "I'm 50% sure. I don't know for sure." I showed you how you can know. The Bible makes it real clear what you have to do. So you said you believe Jesus Christ is God? You believe he died for your sins? He was buried and rose again? Now do you believe that salvation is through faith alone, or do you believe that you have to do some other good work? You have to go to church, you have to repent of your sins? The Bible said believe on Jesus Christ. That was it. Right? And, if you were to get saved today, how long do you believe you'd be saved for? Forever. Now that's a good deal; you want to be saved. If I had something that you wanted, and you knew it was free, and you knew I'd give it to you, what would you do? You'd ask me for it. God has something that you want. So if you want right now, I can pray, you can repeat after me, and I can help you ask God, tell God, "This is what I believe, I want you to save me right now," because tonight's not promised. You could die tonight. You want to be 100%, alright? So if you just repeat this prayer, and mean it, believe it in your heart, God will save you.

## Sinner's Prayer

>Dear Jesus,
>I know I'm a sinner,
>I know I deserve hell,
>but I believe,
>you died for my sins,
>you were buried and rose again,
>I'm putting all my faith on you,
>please save me right now,
>Amen.

## Closing Statements

Now did you mean that? Now if you died today, where're you going? Heaven. That's a good feeling, right? God really loves you, right?

And then look at verse 18,

He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, [why?] because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Now look, we can see just from those 3 verses (I mean, I could show you hundreds), but the point is that it says that everyone who believes on Jesus Christ will be saved. I mean, it says here that whosoever believeth, he that believeth is not condemned. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. Now does that say whosoever is good enough?

You don't think that you're going to heaven because of anything that you're doing, (you're a sinner, you come short), you're putting your faith on him to save you. But I'm going to show you one last verse that kind of ties the whole thing together. This will kind of wrap up the whole thing. It says right here,

If I were to give you a gift—and what's your name by the way? If I said, "Dave, I'm going to give you this Bible as a gift, but I need you to give me $5," is that a gift? Okay, what if I said, "Okay Dave, I'm going to give it to you for free, but I'm going to need you to wash my car"? It's still not a gift. If you've got to do any work for it, it's not a gift. But what if I said, "I'm giving this to you for free. Just take it." Now look, who does that Bible belong to now that I gave it to you? It's yours now. Now can I come back any time I want and just take it from you? What if I come back like a few months from now, and you've done something wrong to me, could I just come in your house and just take this away? No, that would make me what? A thief. And a liar. Well look, the Bible says right here that God has given to us eternal life, (it says in 1 John 5:10 actually),

God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.

Now if God gave it to us, then it belongs to us. He's not going to take it away from you. What I'm trying to say is you can't lose your salvation. I mean, once you're saved, it's eternal life. Okay. It lasts for—do you know what eternal means? Forever. So if you get it and it lasts forever, how many times do you think you have to get that? One time. Could you ever lose it?

Okay? And as soon as God took it back he's a liar. And God, the Bible says,

In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; (Titus 1:2)

So you can't lose it. So let me ask you this, Dave, do you believe you've sinned? Do you believe that Jesus died on the cross for your sins? And you believe he rose again from the dead? Now, according to what I just showed you in the Bible right here, if you were to ask Jesus to save you right now, would he do it? And how long would you be saved for?

I just want to help you tell God that that's what you believe so that you'll know that you're going o heaven. You can just ask to be saved right now. Let's bow our heads right now, you can just repeat this after me, and pray this to God. Go ahead and bow your head and just pray this with me.

The Bible says all liars will have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone? Do you believe that? You don't believe the Bible? Let me explain it to you this way. I need you to understand something, the weight of a crime does not depend on the weight of the sin, but on the dignity of the one that you offended. Lie to me, nothing happens. Lie to a judge, you're in trouble. Walk across my lawn, nothing happens. Walk across the president of the United State's lawn and you get shot. Do you see this? Step on a bug, nobody cares. Kill a human, people care. Why? Because the human has more dignity that the bug. And when the person that you've sinned against, when his dignity is infinite, so is the punishment. Does that make sense? It's an outrage.

The reason we ask people this question is that if you're not 100% sure, that usually means that in your heart, despite whatever you say with your mouth, you believe something besides the blood of Jesus is going to get you there. You believe, "Yeah, We need Jesus, but I still have to live right after I'm saved." Is that what you believe? If a person believes on Jesus, and then commits fornication, and dies, will he go to heaven or hell?

Jesus said ye shall be witnesses unto me. I know you as a witness unto Jesus. How do you witness? "I don't believe that you're supposed to do witnessing. Jesus said that you're supposed to be a witness. … the cross isn't the revelation of my sin. Something underneath of that sin was of great importance to the Father, or great value for him to pay such a high price for me. … Hey I just wanted to tell you how much God loves you. … Hey did you hear the good news? And then they're expecting some amazing news. And then you say, ‘Well Jesus loves you.' And they say, ‘Well I already knew that.' But they don't know. Because the response to knowing that God loves you isn't, ‘I already knew that.' I'm a seed sower. I don't have to go after the juggler vein to get them to pray my prayer. Especially if I'm going back to that place again. I'm just sowing as many seeds as I can so that God has something to work with. Some sow, some water, God brings the increase. Pay for Starbucks for the person in front of you. Say, ‘Hey, listen, I just want to get this for you.' ‘Why?' ‘Because God loves you.' ‘Oh, really…' ‘Yeah, he really does.' And you think that's not going to make an impact because they're disgusted. They're not disgusted with Jesus. They're disgusted with how we've represented him."

There's a difference between Salvific Lordship Salvation, and being confused by people who twist scriptures to make you think that God promises sanctification to everyone who believes. In the end, there's a good chance the latter really believe that they have to do something to get to heaven, when it really comes down to it, however much they deny it, but if they truly are sincere when it's just a judgement call in determining whether people really believe or not, they might be saved.

# Eternal Security

Let's say you get saved today and then twenty years from now you commit murder. And God takes that gift back. He says, "Okay, you're not saved anymore." Was that everlasting? No. And God says it's everlasting. So if God says it's everlasting, and it's not everlasting, what does that make him? A lair. And that's why it says in 1 John 5 that if you don't believe the record that everlasting life is in Jesus, you call God a liar. If you don't believe it's everlasting, then you don't believe the record, and if you don't believe on Jesus, God will judge you by your works on judgement day. If you don't trust in God to save you, you will be like the Israelites in 1 Kings when King Asa hired an army to help them, and God delivered them into the hands of their enemies because they were trusting in swords and strength to win the battle instead of trusting in God.

If you were to die today, would you know 100% that you were going to heaven? You need to know that nothing you could ever do will make you lose what God gave you. And no sin you could ever commit will be stronger than the blood of Jesus that covers all our sins. We have an advocate with the Father. The moment you were saved, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, born again, regenerated from the word genes, and nothing can reverse that. You need to know that, and here's why. If you don't believe that it's everlasting, you call God a liar. Because he says it's everlasting. And if he gives it to you, and then takes it back, it wasn't everlasting. The Bible says even if we stop believing, God cannot deny himself. And when we don't have that assurance that we're saved, it comes down to we think we have to do something to show God that were earnest about this. But that's not trusting Jesus, that's trusting self. And we will always be insecure Christians when we trust self. And we will always live with a condemned conscience if we trust self, even though the Bible says there is no condemnation. But we don't really believe that if we think our sin condemns us. What don't believe what Paul said, everything is permissible, not everything is expedient, or profitable. Everything is permissible. We traded the royal law for the perfect law of liberty. The law was a tutor to bring us to Christ, and now that we have Christ, we leave the tutor behind. The law is a mirror that shows us our faults, to get us to such a place where we say, "I need a savior." You need to know that heaven went bankrupt to purchase you. That's not the revelation of your sin, that's the revelation of your value. That's the revelation of how much you're worth to God. The blood of his son. That's heavy. And if you think that your sin can negate that, you will not have peace. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusts thee. If when you sin, you look at yourself and say, "I have to fix this," you don't have peace and you never will. Peace comes from looking to Jesus. When Peter fixed his gaze on Jesus, and stepped out onto that water, he walked on water. Then he shifted his gaze from Jesus to the waves, and he sank, and Jesus said, "Why did you doubt?" Peter didn't doubt Jesus. He doubted himself. He looked at the waves crashing around him, and he stopped looking at Jesus, and started looking at his humanity, and when we look at our imperfections, we sink. We have to keep our mind stayed on God, or we won't have peace. And I want to invite you to pray this prayer with me right now, and I'll help you call on the Lord to be saved. You say, "I'm already saved." But listen, if you've been under the weight of thinking you have to turn over a new leaf to get right with God and stay saved, and if you've been under the weight of thinking you can lose your salvation, that's the devil snatching up the seed of the gospel. That faith, James said, is dead, and it can't save anyone. This is a serious thing. And I get it. You've had experiences with God. You don't want to concede to the possibility that this whole time you've been praying, and weeping, and studying, that you have not been saved. But you have to lay that aside now, and say, "God, I trust in you today. You say that it's everlasting, and I've never really believed that. I had the language, but it was just like a man saying, ‘Be warmed, be clothed,' and doing nothing about it. That's called lying. And I had the language, saying, "Everlasting life is in Jesus," but in my heart, I really never believed that your gift was everlasting. The gift of God is eternal life. In my heart, I credited you as a thief and a liar, because I thought I might lose it if I was bad enough. I didn't mean to do that, God. I was confused. I would never call you a thief and a liar. That's the devil. He's the one who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. He's the father of lies. Forgive me, God, I was misled at the core of my beliefs. Jesus said the work of God is to believe on his son Jesus, and I admit that my faith was lacking works. It was empty. I believed that Jesus was God's son, I believed that he died and was buried, and rose again on the third day, but I never really trusted him to save me. I treated his sacrifice like a pardon, and after that, I have to improve in my walk with you, and if I don't, I would go to hell. That faith is dead, dear God. That faith is empty. I want to accompany my faith with the work of the perfect law of liberty, which is believing on his son. I've looked into the glass of the perfect law of liberty and seen two truths, that I'm sinful, and that I'm forgiven, and then I walked away and forgot immediately what I looked like. That faith won't save me. I want to trust you completely, dear God. Save me, today." You can pray that. You can tell God, "I want to be saved today. I believe you today, like I never did before." You say, "Why is it such a big deal?" If you receive circumcision, the cross is of no effect to you. In other words, if you believe in Jesus+ some act of faith, Jesus+ baptism, Jesus+ turning away from my sins, Jesus+ growing in my walk with God, you're not saved, and your faith is dead. I know that this is a hard word. But it's Bible. And you say that you believe this book. You can give your life to God right now. Let me help you pray. Do you believe that it's Jesus+ nothing? We're saved by faith apart from works? Nothing you could ever do will cause you to lose your salvation?

You meant that right? Now that you've prayed, God has given you the promised Holy Spirit as the earnest of your inheritance. This is Ephesians 1:13. That means that if God changes his mind, and doesn't give you an inheritance in his kingdom, you get to keep the Holy Spirit. And so either you're going to heaven, or the Holy Spirit goes to hell. And that's not going to happen. You are born again. You have the Holy Spirit. And now the next step of obedience is baptism if you want to live for God.

Well I don't believe I have to do anything to stay saved. – What else is there to be unsure about?

It's like Naaman.

I want to talk to you about something called a discourse community… James is going to use language that his audience will understand. The Jews understand works. Jesus said in John 6:29, the work of God is to believe in his son. So when James says faith without works, he's talking about faith that says, "Yes, God is one. Yes, Jesus is God's son. Yes, Jesus died on the cross for my sins. Yes, Jesus was resurrected from the dead. But no, Jesus . That's an intellectual assent to facts about Jesus. That's not trusting him. And that's what James is talking about. He makes that clear in distinguishing the works of the royal law from the works of the perfect law if liberty, which is able to save your souls. We know that the royal law, or the law handed down from angels to Moses is not able to save anyone. What is? The blood of Jesus. Trusting God. It wasn't how good Gideon's army was that delivered them from the Midianites. It was 300 against 115,000. It wasn't their strength. It was that they trusted in God to save them from what they couldn't possible do on their own. And it's the same in the gospel. Believing in facts don't have you, because that faith is dead. You need to have the work of the perfect law of liberty, which is believing on the Lord Jesus, that eternal life is in God's son, not of works that any man should boast. Not of obedience, or living right after you get saved, and if oyu don't live right, God will take away your salvation. If something is a gift, can I take it back? No, that would make me a thief. And If I said, "This is everlasting," and then I took it away, it wasn't everlasting, was it? Which makes me a liar. So this calls God a thief and a liar. This isn't a discussion about living right, it's a discussion about what kind of faith saves you. And faith without the work of the perfect law if liberty, which is what James is talking about, which is believing on Jesus for Christ for righteousness, is dead. Your faith is dead right now. Do the work. Stop calling God a thief, and stop calling him a liar. Believe in him. Repent and believe the gospel. Obey God when he says, "Believe." To all them that obey he covers.

You don't have to be sanctified. The Bible doesn't say, "Be sanctified and thou shalt have eternal life." It says, "Believe and thou shalt have eternal life."

# If they don't want to pray

Now when I first got here, you said you weren't 100% sure you were going to heaven, and I think it's because you thought, you know, "I've done good, I've done bad," and you weren't really a hundred percent sure you were good enough to make it. But now you see that that has nothing to do with it. It's just whether or not you believe.
