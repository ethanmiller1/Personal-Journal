# Rules

1.      I never raise my voice over 80 Decibels.
2.      I never scrunch my eyes in anger or disgust.
3.      I remain calm and cool, smiling even in the face of insult or offense.
4.      If my thoughts are for evil, I keep silent.
5.      The appropriate setting for rebuke is never a reaction.
6.      God is more real to me than people; I seek His praise, not man's praise.
7.      I seek opportunities to be humbled happily.
8.      I laugh.

# Retorts

>  "You do it all the time" "then I guess there should have been someone to tell me not to do it."

> "Why don't you go fishing, to restore your sense of human values."

> "She's my responsibility!" "Oh good, I'm glad to hear you say that. Why don't you live up to it.?"

> He is not uncommon who sees but does not understand, who hears but does not perceive. For in his own sight every man right, but there is only one through whom knowledge flows.

> "Girls rule!" "Not a fact. God rules. Always has. Always will."

> "I love you." "Well you sure do a lousy job of making me believe it."

> "What makes you such a pleasant one anyhow?"

> I would appreciate it if you wouldn't volunteer my services as if I am under obligation to do as you command me. Slavery was rightly done away with. It makes it difficult for me to think well of you.

> Selfishness is no way to live.

> "Father, there are those who make us curse them in our hearts. Silence the unspoken words before they spill out and cause dissension. Amen."

> "Anna, I'm going to have to ask you to respect our boundaries. I know is hot over there, but when it's in cabins time, you need to be in your room." "He literally turned the air off." "You can stay if you want, but know you'll be violating my respect if you do."

> You're so naive. You deal in two shades of white. Whoever blinds themselves to all the colors are the most likely to be deceived by them. Only the callow fail to see a door that's black, and they go on to bump into it because they refuse to admit it's there.

> Pina Calada boy / you make the girls go ah, and when the sun goes down you make my world spin 'round. Clearly she's talking about being the fruit of the spirit in the life of believers. That's why she says you naughty boy, go to my room, because that's what Christ does, isn't it? Yes, you are naughty, you have sinned, you have transgressed Me, and yet I'm inviting you into my house so that through Me you will bear the fruit of the spirit, the pina calada so to speak. And again she says shut your mouth and get it on, my patience shorter than my skirt, because patience is a fruit of the spirit and she isn't producing it so she wants Christ to "get it on."

> everybody take it off. And they turn me on when they take it off. What Ke$ha is taking about here is taking off the old  self which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and putting on the new self which in the likeness of God is being created in righteousness And holiness of the truth. And therefore when they take it off, they turn me on, because as you lay aside the old self you are renewed in the spirit of your mind.

> You must have some weird friends.

> "Why are you doing the dishes?" "Well, because it makes me so happy to do the dishes, and I know happy company is good company so I figured I would do some things to make me happy so that I will be good company for you. An nd i know that you want me to be happy so i figured...so that you might be happy.

> "you said such and such." "Oh, well that's not what I meant."

> "such and such declaration." (They are wrong) *say nothing* 90% of things that people argue against or try to correct are absolutely trivial with no significance on how you ought to live your life.

> "Do you want to play with us?" "Well that would be so much fun. . . . but I think I better do something useful. . . . I haven't finished my checklist yet. . . . I think I'll do something else."

> the only reason I would have to argue with an offence is of I felt their offense was justified. "Are you kidding me? What are you doing?" As I lay on the couch. "What am I doing?" "Your just sleeping in the middle of the Living room?" "Not sleeping, but why would that matter?" "Your right, that shouldn't matter, but this is my two hours of alone time that I go bazerk and clean everything in the house." "Oh, I'm sorry. I'll move." The reason I didn't need to contend is because she recognized that she had no basis for argument against me. If she did, I probably would've defended myself and found something to blame. But truthfully, if she had a basis, that is the greater moment that requires my apology. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. . . . I wasn't thinking. . . . I wasn't soft, but God has softened me since then."

> "what a nice invitation." "I'm sure the nice gentlemen will excuse us."

> "conserve your strength dear."

> "she's an orderly woman isn't She? She likes everything nice and neat under her heading. The trouble is her headings are all wrong."

> "we shall set our own house in order without recourse to your so called law."

> "If you spent half the energy making friends as you do discouraging friends I think you'd find things a whole lot easier."

> That's a heavy confession. It's a very common one, surprisingly, because there is so much shame attached to it.

> There are at least three reasons to confess something, one is in hopes that I will justify you, one is hopes I will convince you it's wrong, and the other in hopes that I can help you.

> Forgive me. I meant no offence.

> I feel like that's more of a response than a conviction.

> Be that as it may . . .

> I feel like that's sort of a pedantic argument.

> In the interest of keeping matters civil, I'd ask you to abandon your frequent use of pettifogging.

> You're such a contrarian. Concerned with trivial detail that's non-sequitur to the sake of the argument (that is, the issue at hand). Truculent responses never serve anybody.

> If you had put it away somewhere that wasn't ill-suited you wouldn't be having this problem. Until you learn to find an appropriate spot for your things I assume you will keep having this problem. If you can put your things in an adequate spot, you'll stop losing them, but dumping your stuff all over the tables and counters is, in my opinion, inadmissible.

> [Name], I'd really hate to confront you about such a minor thing, but the way you're talking is starting to rub off on me. If it was me who had to hear it, I would do my best to tolerate it, but now other people have to tolerate it in me.

> Walk in such a way that you see Jesus with you. When you're speaking, picture Jesus standing right next to you. What does He want me to say? What would He say? Imagine a spherical presence surrounding your heart, Jesus' presence through the presence of the Spirit.

> He did not know fear, he did not know rebellion; he only knew faith as he stood there in an array of bullets, none of which harmed him. Then the shooter knew fear. "what's happening?"

> You're family whether you're friends or not, so friend is higher up on the hierarchy of relationships than family.

> That wasn't a confession. That was at best an intellectual ascent that what you did was wrong and at worst poorly-crafted propaganda for the sake of preserving your argument.

> The moment an argument becomes hostile it no longer serves any purpose. It's just two unwavering opposing forces clashing in an ugly display of words that doesn't change anyone's mind.

> If someone judged you to be ungodly, the only way you could prove them to be wrong is accept it. It's such a contradiction that we so often defend our image with hostility, which in the end only does harm to that image we were trying to defend.

> I mean this in the most loving way that I can say it, so that I won't let any unwholesome words proceed from my mouth but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment so that it will give Grace to those who hear, but your questions have no impact on the way I live or make decisions or how I think.

> I appreciate the edification, but I hope that it was from the Holy Spirit and not just a response from your natural man who sees himself fit to put himself on God's throne of judgement, because we will be judged for every word we say, and James says when we're talking about the things of God we're going to be judged harshly.

> I understand, it's not for everyone.

> "She's all I've got." "If you don't mind my saying so ma'am, she may be all you've got, but what you've got sure is fine."

> That's quite the provocative accusation, coming from you.

> Men of vision have so often been mocked. Galileo knew it was the earth that orbited the sun and he was sentenced to death for that discovery.

> Coincidence. That's an explanation used by fools and liars.

> I'm afraid you're lacking in good judgment.

> "Hey how's your time with the Lord? Do you guys get in some time together with the Lord, you know praying together, read your Bibles?"

> Such as life.

> That's nonsense.

> I'm going to have to call you on your sources.

> That's propaganda.

> You have an impressive ability to obscure the truth.

> You'll be a whole lot better off of you go home and work it out.

> What tangled webs we weave. . .

> Dunn makes the mistake of building his writing on the premise that death is an event, when, in fact, death may be profoundly more. Semantically, death can mean a wide array of things. But theologically death isn't it's own thing, it's  the lack of a thing; just as darkness is the absence of light, or cold is the absence of heat, death is merely the absence of life. And therefore poetically speaking it's cute that he says death will be out of a job when the last person dies, but theologically if the dead remain dead, that would make death a poetic king. Before we can define death we must first define life. Jesus said (John 17:3), and therefore we were dead in our sins because our sin separated us from God. Even with the hope of the ressurection there is a promise of those who will be lead away from the presence of the Lord, eternally under the reign of death. The event of our pulse stopping is just our passage into eternity, whether we are claimed by death or claimed by God isn't dependent of our pulse.

> I'm not going to pretend I know that … so I won't be interpreting what dun meant by the poem, but rather scrutinizing the comfort it offers. What do you have to believe to be comforted by this? There are consequences for taking poetic license too far with the word of God.

> I'll never deny God's will,  but I do ask that you go about this prayerfully in the guidence of the Spirit because I really do like the way it is. But again, I'll never oppose God's wishes for my sake.

> Blank name sori of came drink milk when his babies can't.  Drink milk like water here.  Out of compulsion I vowed to watch the way I spend money on food. I don't like to think of how rock I am.  I wouldn't feel right taking money. I'm not needy in respect to finances.

> What's YOUR name? – buddy the elf

> Does somebody need a hug?

> I didn't know.

> Are you mad?

> Sounds like somebody needs to sing a Christmas Carroll.

> That's a pretty purple dress.

> Fransisco. That's fun to say.

> Hi. Do you remember me?

> Thank you,  Deborah!

> "Do you want to play?" "Well, I was just about to start working on my project. Maybe in a few hours?"

> "I have a question." "Can't talk right now, write it down and I'll answer it in the evening."

> What is God's will for us right now? Maybe He wants us to do something else. Let's find out. I'll go get a Bible.

> That hurt my feelings.

> I'm not interested in interacting with someone who changes their mind as often as they change their clothes.

> I'll be honest,  I'm a very unrighteous parson, which is why I've got to guard myself carefully. I see a female body, and my sinful heart desires her beauty. Good made it pretty simple.  Man sees female body,  he gets excited,  babies.  There is nothing more profoundly beautiful to a man that a woman, so when I see one, something in me says "I want that." If you're not in business, don't advertise. So when women dress in a way that shows themselves, it makes it difficult for people like me, to keep from wanting her. We're losing integrity in America, in Europe, all over.  We're less monogamous than hamsters. We're taking something beautiful that God creatures for His glory and using it to glorify ourselves, which is a gross distortion.

> If you say so. . . I don't remember feeling that way.

> "You're just saying that to make me feel better." "Is it working?"

> Well g_oo_dness gracias, we just can't seem to agree on anything, can we?

> This is not the kind of man you want to be.

> You don't have to live this way.

> You're telling me that in 24 hours you have something filling in every slot that's more important than coming before the creator and sustainer of the universe?

> I don't know if that would be quite in character for me.

> You know, it's funny that you have a poster outside your door saying your goal is God Himself. Why don't you live that way?

> Your posters say you want to be like Christ. Why don't you live up to it?

> I fail to see how you could support this claim against a complete stranger.

> "I felt like I needed an excuse to talk to you." "Excuse accepted. Let's go upstairs."

> I'm sorry, that was unwholesome talk. Forgive me.

> Do you know what a democracy is? Demos is a Greek word that means people. Cratin is another Greek word that means rule. Democracy: rule of the people. A people is a crowd, and friend, I'm one of the crowd.

> "I will not take charity from anyone!" "You won't listen to anyone either. Do you know you are the most egocentric, obstinate, pig-headed mule that I've ever known?"

> I can't stop you from talking, but I sure can stop you from doing.

> I would change my hairstyle for you.

> Your judgement of me is too gracious. But each man knows the bitterness of his own heart. I'm not teacher material.

> Oh hush. Unwholesome words.

> "Your family just has all kinds of health problems." "Not problems—reminders. Reminders that this mortal coil of ours isn't our home."

> Your positivity makes me cringe.

> Neiva, gullible, blind . . . these are just pessimistic words for trusting. I'm not oblivious to betrayal, but no matter how many times they betray my trust, I prefer to believe in people, and when I have the upper hand, I will always have mercy on the ones who ask for it. I know they will betray me again; it's not about them. It's about the kind of person I want to be. Again and again, there's one thing that can break an endless cycle of hurt: it's hope.

> No, no. Charity is for those in need, not those in want (in greed to make it rhyme).

> Nothing is here except a stupid thought which I will not entertain.

> It is ill advice to entertain a thought from the wellspring of folly.

> Asmodeus whispers his profanity to your thoughts (thoughts to your head); resist his deceits and do not entertain his council. He does not seek your good but the undoing of it.

> God in His wonderful, abundant, rich mercy knew that I would not be righteous enough to handle a good looking body well, so He decided, "You know what? To preserve this guy's virginity and humility, I'm going to screw him up a bit." So here I am with the body I have because of God's mercy, not His wrath.

> "So you want to be a hermit with no friends?" "Are you done? Because I can think of better names for you to call me than hermit. Might I suggest a course in ‘How to effectively dehumanize a person who's logic outweighs yours'?"

> Upon reflection I realize I may have acted inappropriately about the wizard family robe.

> "I'm actually home alone, if you know what I mean." "Ohh, I see what you're saying, you're having a little prayer time. I'll just leave you alone and come back later."

> "What's with the tie?" "What's with the question?"

> Ties compliment the professional appeal of scholarly individuals.

> The labor is nothing, it's the devises that count, and the devices belong to my parents so your appreciation really belongs to them.

> Don't deprive me of my good will.

> You want to pay me back? Testify about me on judgement day… Just kidding, I'm not offering these filthy rags to Him.

> "Do you want to go out?" "I don't want to waste your time. I don't subscribe to ‘the one' theology, where there's a perfect match for you out there somewhere, and if you marry the wrong person you're in trouble, but I've already asked the Lord about you. I was out running, and was like, ‘If it's good to the Lord and seems right that I should pursue her, bring her home while I'm running. Otherwise keep her away until I'm inside. I ran home, and you hadn't come home that night. ‘Okay Lord, you are good and faithful, may I be faithful to receive the word which You have spoken.'"

> You're smiling in a way that presupposes our cooperation. Don't take that for granted.

> "I prefer not to use pejoratives."

> I'm sorry Deborah, I can't life your kind of lifestyle. It's too sporadic and thoughtless. I cannot stand the extroverted lifestyle, just spending your life away hanging out. I have to put these hands to use, and do something that I know will actually accomplish things. I don't want to just spend 2 hours being a goffer for Brian who's doing the real work because I've got better uses for my time, and I don't want to spend 2 hours at a play or whatever because I've got better uses for my time.

> I don't think that's what I want to be doing when Christ returns. I'd rather be found at home praying, or doing something eternal.

> The question we should be asking is not what words they're using, but what they are saying.

> Do you know why psychology is a profession? It's because people have a hard time understanding themselves. People looking in from the outside can usually get to the root of why someone does the things that they do better than the person who does them.

> Everybody knows it's a futile enterprise to try to convince someone you're calm.

> "Do you want to play?" "If I could only pause time, believe me I would." – "It's a work day."

> "God bless you." "He already has."

> "insert accusation" "is that right?"

> What color are my eyes? So much for eye witnesses.

> Took me eight hours to reach this level of perfection. (Bed hair)

> "Thoughts?" "I try and preserve my thoughts for things I care about. And this doesn't qualify."

> Martha, Martha, Esau gave up his birthright for a single meal. Don't make his mistake.

> If you had asked me, I might've considered it. But exercising authority over me which has not been granted you shows an arrogance I will not interact with nor entertain.

> I'm afraid you didn't understand.

> I'm afraid I misspoke.

> "wasted space"… space wasn't meant to be occupied…God only made three percent of land habitable.

> If shawty is going to have a conversation with me shawty is going to have to understand that I'm going to be honest even if it makes you uncomfortable. But now you be honest, you're not uncomfortable, you're flattered. I would be.

> In Jesus' name, be silent.

> "I didn't post to start an argument." "Oh, you didn't post to start an argument? What, you were hoping everyone would just agree with you or shut up if they don't?"

> "Yeah, keep believing that." "Thanks, but I don't need your permission."

"I don't want to get in an argument with you." " but that's what democracy is all about. it's about sharpening two points of view and may the best argument win."

> "oh the Jesus answer." "No I mean that. Jesus lives in me and speaks through. He said if you abide in me and my words abide in you … so I hope that every answer is the Jesus answer. Let's not water down His name by correlating it with superficiality in the way we talk."

> Are you a prophet? "No." Then do not proclaim things to me which you do not know.

> "Not necessarily." "I'm not talking about necessarily; I'm talking about probably."

> "Never stand on a swivel chair." "More people get injured from stacking chairs leaning over than from swivel chairs rolling away. Swivels are statistically safer."

> "There's Ethan, stoic as always." "I'm only stoic around you because you say such hurtful things." And if I rebuttal she gets uber-offended. Something in Anna's psychology tries to preserve one person's continence without thought to the other person. For example, dad paid for me to go on the sky coaster and I had a stoic look because they were teasing me about being nervous because I didn't want to go due to the expense. So I didn't want to express emotion that could be mistaken for anxiety. However, it looked like I didn't enjoy it, but to preserve dad's feelings Anna pointed out that Ethan is always stoic. To which I said, "I'm not always stoic." To which she said, "Yeah you are; usually." And then I realized it's because I get very offended at Anna, so I'm on guard to not react defensively when she's around, because I know she doesn't intend offense. The result is a stoic attitude. She will debase me to honor Deborah, and I don't think she realizes it, or leastwise believes that it doesn't bother me. She's very judgmental and quick to judge, so I don't let myself be nonchalant in her witness. Her first 20 years of life was her correcting our grammar, mispronuncoations, behavior, the music we listened to, the words we said, finding schemes where there were none. It isn't a wonder why I've come to expect a rebuke from her when I ought least expect it. She's unpredictably admonishing.
