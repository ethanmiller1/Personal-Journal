## What degree are you pursuing?

I'm trying to figure that out; just knocking out the basic courses right now. For awhile I was pretty sure I was going for a Business degree in Finance, and that was because I had TD Ameritrade education, and was taught how to read the market, and that's something I enjoyed, but I also liked the idea of network marketing as well, because it's flexible, you get out of it what you put into it. So I thought, "Well, Business Finance kind of applies to everything so I'll just go for that."

A lot of people took Amway as a joke in my father's generation, but since then it's become over an 18 billion-dollar industry, so, you know, the numbers don't lie.

## Are you going to college?

I am. I go to Collin College, Spring Creek campus. Wonderful people there. It has a little bit of a high school taste to it, but overall I've really enjoyed classes there, the ones that I didn't skip. It's amazing the most random places that you meet people who have a huge impact on your life. There was a dude in my math class, Mauri, who I was new to apologetics, and he referred me to William Lane Craig, and just opened new avenues of learning in that area that have really proven useful on the mission field.

## What college do you plan to attend?

DBU Lord willing. They have an absolutely beautiful campus and town homes. I'm somewhat familiar with the professors there since my sister is an alumni, and every time I visited her there I was blown away by spirit of worship in that place. In every speech, recognition, chapel, even personal small talk the Spirit of God is just emanated from the godly men and woman who are there, and I would love to be part of that for a while if college is something I end up pursuing further.

## What are your plans?                                                                                     

In a man's heart he plans his course, but the Lord directs his steps. I was going for a finance degree, because I really enjoy trading options with TOS, started with TD Ameritrade when I was 14, and I like making money and travelling

A man's life is not his own, and it is not for him to direct his steps.

Figure I'll take some time off. Float around, see where the currents take me.

## Graduation Speech

Characters throughout the Bible, like Jesus or Paul, were not known because of what they did for a living. Jesus was a carpenter, and Paul was a tent-maker. It wasn't because of their professions that their lives counted, it was because of who they were and how they lived. Paul said I die every day, because that's how he lived. He put away the natural self and lived by the Spirit. My plan for now, for the next few years, and for the rest of my life is to get up day by day, put away the old self, put on the new self, and live not according to the flesh but by the Spirit put to death the deeds of the body. And that is not just the manner by which I will live, it is the means by which I will live, as Paul puts it in Romans 8.

## What do you like to do?

* Okay, I we're going to play this game, where I say a thing, and then you say a thing.
* I like to play tennis. Your turn.
* I go bowling sometimes.
* I love to running.
* There's nothing I enjoy more than sitting down on a quiet night with a book.
* Absolutely love to worship and pray.
* I watch a lot of sermons.
* I love horticulture and making things grow from little seeds and braches,
* I've got plenty more in my arsenal.
* I like coffee.
* Sometimes when it rains I sit quietly by a window, open it up at the top, and breath in the fresh, crisp fall air.

## What do you usually do on the weekends?

## So I take it you don't do porn?

Actually I do. I'm in rehab right now, working on that. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the worst for me, for some reason. I can pretty much go through every other day without feeling very tempted, but then either Tuesday or Wednesday comes along, and it's like I've got to shut down my computer, through away my phone, push myself working out to get dopamine in my brain, and for some reason I'm sitting there at night and my mind just wanders away like a confused sheep. So yeah, working on that, hoping it will be totally out of my life before I turn 20. I do not want to take this with me as I exit teenager-hood.

## What have you been up to lately?

## Hello, Is This Ethan Miller?

* Man, quit calling me! Man, I'm going to shove a porcupine up your nose!
* Um, who is this?
* I'm not going to speak to you until you until you meet my demands, you hear? I want a chocolate pony rainbow with double twisted orphan meat on the side. I won't tell you my name until I get it. Are we understanding each other?
* This is an important call.
* Now hold on their, charley, is it going to matter in a thousand years?
* Um, no, but...
* Well then how important could it be, huh? If it is not going to matter in the end, it sure doesn't really matter at all, does it?
* Hey, you listen to me, next time you call this number I'm going to call the police on you, and it usually takes them about three minutes to track a phone line and get to any centralized location, and they're going to be all up in your donkeys if that happens. I'm going shove a burning stick so far down your donkeys its excrement will always be melted!
* Sweet macaroni and cheese! I just heard Robin Hood is back in town! Let's go find out if it's true. Meet me at Grand Central Station in 10 minutes. Bye!
* Are you a female?
* What, is that some kind of a black joke? You listen here, kid, if you're a minute late I'm going beat your unspeakables so bad it's going to be blacker than me!

## Thank you for being here.

Oh it's a pleasure. I appreciate you guys opening your home to us, and all this craziness for a few days. It can be burden to give up your home for the sake of the church, but I'm grateful to see that church oneness with you guys, the body as a whole to function together.

I'm taking it easy this semester. I've always said that priority assumes urgency, not importance, and right now there are some things more urgent to me, more foundational than school. Like my character. They don't teach you to be a virtuous person in college. I want to set aside some time to work on those issues.

# Contentions

* Now there you surprise me.
* I find it best to reserve judgment for certainty, the Lord and truth.
* In my judgment,
* I prefer to give honor and not dishonor.
* have you no sympathy?
* have you no regard for the shunning of gossip?
* without gossip a quarrel dies down, so I find it best in the interest of preserving the unity of the Spirit to reserve ill judgment for the Lord.
* Let us proceed, I implore you to speak well of those we cannot judge, lest we take what brings to God.
* Judgment does not belong to men.
* your whole teaching is that they were pretty messed up so you don't have to feel bad about how messed up you are. That's not edifying. If you think the extent of the genesis narrative, it's highest purpose, is so that we can see that people are flawed, I think we're missing something.
* Anna, Anna, you are worried about many things, but only one thing is necessary.
* I can tell you're disturbed by this.
* I can tell your upset, please don't be. This is a very little matter.
* calm yourself, Morgana.
* speak kindly, woman, and I will listen. But speak with acrimony and I will turn a def ear.
* Be gentle, Anna, lest you should not be known to belong to Christ, for a tree is known by the fruit that it bears.
* be careful, the wise gives a soft answer.
* I'm a sophisticated investor for the new age.

## Do you want to play?          

* Oh, are you bored? (Sympathetic gentle soft tone)
* Why don't you grab a coloring book and you can color while I'm working.
* Why don't you come sit up here with me and I'll show you what I'm working on.
* That's a good idea, but
* I'm very busy at the moment; can we discuss this in one hour? [1](http://www.planetofsuccess.com/blog/2011/learn-to-say-no/)
* I can't manage that as I have to focus on important affairs.
* I'm not too confident with that. Why don't you ask X?
* Thanks for the gracious invitation, but no.
* That's awfully kind of you, but we're unable to make it. [2](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-politely-refuse-an-invitation-without-lying-if-I-just-dont-want-to-attend)

## What kind of job are you working for to support my daughter?

In a man's heart he plans his course, but it's the Lord that directs his steps. Listen friend, if you want somebody to be rich and really successful and never have to depend on God for their daily bread, if you want someone who can make this life as comfortable as it can be, as painless, suffer-less and easy, I'm the wrong guy for your daughter, because I couldn't care less about what I lose in this life. I live by these words that the best thing you can do for somebody _in_ this life, is not _for_ this life. And for anyone to be with me, they have to understand that, and that's why I love your daughter. . . . I guess that was a little bold, um . . . that's what I love about your daughter. There we go, that's less direct.

## Do you want to go out?

You know, dating is really just a long drawn out way of figuring each other out and seeing if you're compatible. Why don't we just play 20 questions right here right now and keep things quick? Yeah?

1) Out of all the colors you've encountered in this universe, which one is your favorite?
	1) Orange.
	2) Oooh, that's an automatic deal-breaker. Just kidding!
2) What's your favorite color?
	1) You can't repeat the question! I've got an idea, before I can ask a question, I have to answer it. For example, my favorite color is green. Your favorite color is ______, and then you say orange.
3) My favorite movie is The Lion King. Your favorite movie is ______?
	1) Bong Bop Bop
	2) That sounds stupid.
4) My favorite song is In the Light by dc Talk. You favorite song is ______?
	1) Example by Illustration
	2) I don't know that song. If I don't know the song, then you have to sing it!
	3) What?! No. Let me pull it out on my phone.
	4) Uh-uh, no cheating! That's the rule for this relationship! Hahaha.
