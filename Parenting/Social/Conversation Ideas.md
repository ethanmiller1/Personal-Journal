# Spring 2023

* "I'm sorry!" – "If that's the worst thing that happened to me today it's a pretty good day!" ~ Billy

# Summer 2016

* "How are you?" – "I'm doing so good" (Todd White enthusiasm)
* "Ethan!" – "Mr. Blank! I'm so glad to see you this morning.
* "Why?" "Because it's so good; this is the day that the Lord has made."
* Hey, hey, it's my good friend Jody! 
* Hey man, I'm Ethan! I just wanted to tell you how much God loves you.
* Oh I promise.
* So much so that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
* Yeah. Did you know that you don't pay more for something than its worth? Check this out. Heaven went bankrupt to purchase you.
* Do you believe in heaven and hell?
* "Why are you talking about this?" Because so many people are going to hell and I can't live with that.
* Because eternity is at stake. We can talk about different political and economic policies and in a thousand years none of it will make a difference. But Jesus, whether you know Him or not affects forever.
* Dude this world and everything that's in it, it's just water that you sip and then thirst again. But Jesus, man once you drink from that fountain you never thirst again.
* Are you a Christian? "No." Do you want to become one? 
* Man, He's a good, good Father. That's what Christianity is about. Pure and undefiled religion is this: caring for the orphan and the widow. And who is an orphan but one who doesn't know their Father?
* "Oh I'm a Christian." Praise God! That means a lot to me. Do you go to church?
* Come here often? (in class) "Not my type…" Oh that's okay, I'm not my type either. 
* Hey, hey! It's my good friend who's name I totally remember, but just to make sure, what was it again?

# Alpha M.

* Conversation starters (if number 1 doesn't go very far, I'll hit em with number 2, 3, 4…)
* What do you do for a living?
* When you're not working, what do you like to do?
* So! How's your day going?
* Got any big plans this weekend? 
* Compliment
* FORM: family, occupation, recreational hobbies, message
* 

# Spring Semester 2016

* How are you doing today?
* How was your day today? Did you do anything fun? 
* Beautiful day out today, isn't it?
* That's a cute dress, red really suites you.
* Hey Belle! Are you having a good day today?

# Fall Semester 2015

* Well howdy, I'm Ethan. 
* Well I'm happy to know you miss Kelly, 
* Have you been at Collin long?
* What other classes are you taking?
* What professor do you have for that?
* Where are you from?
* A native Texan, huh? Me too.
* I tell you, I was hoping this would be a window room.
* Have you ever had a class in the library?
* Did you have a good summer?
* Are you ready for school to start back up? Taking a full semester?
* I learned a long time ago that church and biblical Christianity have very little in common.
* I've heard that Yarbrough is always late.
* Did you get a lot of recommendations for Yarborough? I even had a professor say, "Take Yarbrough!"
* I quite fancy you from time to time when you're not yelling at me.
* I'm winning you over, I can feel it.
* I told you we were getting along.

# Spiritual

* Can I count on you Caleb?
* I think we may have missed the boat, but the boat hasn't left us yet.
* Guys, um, can we just, thank God together for His goodness tonight? There's something so crucial, I think, in life, that we could miss anything else but if we miss this one thing, I think we've really missed out on what Christ has purchased for all of us. And that's the Holy Spirit. I look around, and I think we just miss it here in America. And I don't want to be a family that misses it, so tonight I'm hoping that we can start to change the direction of this house. In Ephesians Paul says "Be filled with the Holy Spirit." and He gives us four pointers on how to do it. One of them is to sing spiritual songs and hymns, so my ambition is that this week we will sing a hymn, and a spiritual song, the same one every night this week so that we can all get used to it and really sing it to the fullest. I want us to learn some praises to God, because it's so important, and I think it is really one of the things in life that we really ought to give time to.
* If our house burned down, what would you replace?
Ice Breakers
* Hi, I'm Ethan. It's a pleasure. So where are you from? Oh really? What school did you go to? Are you going to college now?
* You look so familiar, have we ever met?
* I am going to kill you.
* Hey I'm Ethan, tell me your name? Okay Melchizedek, I'm going to use your name a few times in a conversation to help me remember it. See, when you use it...
* What has been the part of your day?
* Pick someone on campus and give them a piece of gum, say "this is a gift from me to you," and see what happens next.
* Dare I ask which body part you're looking at...? ;)
* Don't you owe me money?
* How much did a polar bear weigh? Enough to break the ice. I'm Ethan.
* Interesting work?
* Bethany White. Well what a pleasure it is to come in and find a beautiful woman waiting for me. You both look lovely.
* I happen to have a little free time right now, Vita, you're welcome to all of it.
* Charming place. My name's Dowd. Let me give you my card. If you should ever want call me you can call my cell there.
* Well I'm happy to know you miss Kelly, 
* Uh huh, well I'd be glad to miss Kelly, but there was another very charming girl in here a minute ago, and she asked me to wait. I don't like to disappoint her, she seemed to have her heart set on it.
* Always a very pleasant way to start the day. After you.
* Isn't she lovely? Isn't she beau…? You're very lovely my dear.
* After miss Kelly.
* These things are often the basis of a very long, warm friendship.
* Well now there you surprise me.
* I'm going to surprise you, I think that…
* Oh-ho, well, you have a very nice sense of hummer, doesn't he miss Kelly?
* You know, I like you Dowd. – Well I like you too, Doctor. And miss Kelly here, I certainly do like you. Now you to have been so pleasant, why don't we keep on going with it. I'd like to invite you to come downtown with me, and we'll go to a charming place called…
* I wish you could meet him miss Chumney, I'm sure he'd be quite taken with you.
* Now don't you think that's rather too bas misses Chumley?
* You're a very brilliant man.
* Now let's stick to the facts.
* I don't like to see you standing.
* The evening wore on. With your permission I'll say it again.
* Mr. Cracker, may I intercede for my friends? Youth and high spirits. Time will take care of that.
* Goodbye. My regards to you and anybody else you happen to run into.
* May I take hold of your hand?
* For you I'd do anything, I'd almost be willing to live my life over again.
* Where did you go? – Oh I was just looking for someone. – Why don't you come back inside? – Well alright, if you want me to. It seemed to be so pleasant out here.
* That's envy, my dear. There's a little bit of envy in the best of us. And that's too bad. Isn't it?
* You have the advantage on me. You know my name, and I don't know yours.
* I think the world and all of Ed, but he was spiffed.
* Did you ever know the Macklhaney's? That's too bad. Very nice people. Just wonderful people.
* Miss Kelly perhaps you'd like this flower. You know, when you wear my flower you make it beautiful. "A diver grace has never brightened this enchanting face." ~ Ovid's Fifth Elegy
* So far I can't think of any place I'd rather be. I always have a wonderful time wherever I am, whomever I'm with. I'm having a fine time right here with you Doctor.
* She did all that in one day? That vita is certainly a whirlwind, isn't she? – Good heavens man, haven't you any righteous indignation? – Oh Doctor, years ago, my mother used to say to me, she'd say, "In this world, Elwood, you must be oh so smart, or oh so pleasant." For years I was smart, I recommend pleasant. And you may quote me. 
* Wouldn't that get a little monotonous? I can't help feeling, Doctor, that you're making a mistake not allowing the woman to talk. And I'm sure you're making a mistake with all that beer and no whiskey, but it's your two weeks. 
* Oh miss Kelly. Well how nice to see you.
* I want to leave, you want me to stay. An element of conflict in any discussion is a very good thing. Shows everybody is taking part, nobody is left out. 
* Howdy do. Dowd's my name, Elwood P. I'm glad to know you Mr. Alfred. Have you live around here long, Mr. Alfred? Oh, nice. Enjoy your work? Is that so? Well that's very interesting. Well let me give you my card. Would you like to have dinner with us? I'm glad to have met you, Mr. Alfred. 
* They make a beautiful couple, don't they? Mr. Wilson has such a dynamic personality.
* May we have the pleasure of your company tomorrow night for dinner?
* You know I like you, Julianna. I hope to see you very soon. Why don't you and your family join us for dinner tomorrow night? Just very informal, we'll have a lovely evening. Perfect. Come by around 6:00. Until tomorrow.
* Gomer, what do you do in Mayberry when you're sitting with a girl with the lights turned down low?
* At some point in your relationship, instead of bringing her flowers, bring her a seed. Explain that most relationships are like the flowers that the men give to the women. They have no root, and they only last for a little while before they begin to fade and wither. But a seed that's nurtured and cared for and looked after grows until it blossoms and becomes a beautiful flower. That's what you're hoping for with her. Something that flourishes and remains and hasn't been cut from the beginning. Something that waits until its time, and once it blooms means more than a random display of picked out flowers ever could, because you watched it grow from the beginning.

# Bethany 

* Haha! Wow, haven't seen you in like 10 +years! You look great! You're so. . . . short now. You were taller than me last time I was in your company.
* How are you?
* How's Sam? Is he off and married?
* What about you, any marital status? Got someone in mind?
* Awesome, awesome! Lucky guy. What's his name?
* Too bad Deborah's not here, she would love to see you! Y'all hung out a lot, right?
* Deborah's actually taking music classes at Collin College right now. She took a mission trip to Prague a few years ago and really felt God calling her to the ministry. So she's just taking some classes at Collin waiting to see what God has planned for her. She thinks God is calling her to one of five groups in the Czech Republic, but you know, in a man's heart he plans his way, but it's the LORD who directs his steps, so she's waiting for clarity from God on that one. She's actually going to take off this summer to spend a year doing mission work in Papua New Guinea with some relatives we have up there, ministering to the Kaluli tribes under the support of  Wycliffe Bible translators.
* Man. So you still live in Wylie? I thought you moved like, away. I don't even think you said goodbye to us, you just sort of dropped off the face of the earth. I remember wondering what happened to you guys. I didn't like the people that moved in after you, there was a girl like a year or two older than me that I had major beef with. She was a bully to me. I got in trouble like every time we exchanged words, because attitude is super contagious.
* You were here one minute and gone the next-I am having a moment here.

# Blanchard 

* Say Blanchard, did you already find someone for the position you were texting Brian about? To help create discipleship material?
* I'm kind of interested in it myself. One of my strong passions is making media resources, to take advantage of the technology we have now and put it towards a use that will glorify God somehow or expand His kingdom.
* My experience is with taking hour long sermons and cutting them up into a few minutes, adding music, and doing kinetic typography with After Effects to make it a sermon jam. I have set up a Plex server to host sermons from people like Francis Chan to John Piper, I have like 67 different speakers and their ministries on my server.
* I don't know a lot about videography, or setting up mics, or soundboards, or lighting, or any of that, but I was born into the information freeway we call the internet, and I can learn whatever I need to.
* I don't have the skills of my brother, but if I have the Holy Spirit than Lord willing He will enable me to do what needs to be done.
* I think you said it well in one of your sermons many moons ago, "College is a lot of work for something that's only going to want you for forty years." I don't want to live this life for this life.
* If what we're doing helps somebody to experience God more fully or understand Him better than that's really all I'm after. Whether or not I have a salary won't matter in a thousand years. I want to put my energy towards something eternal.

# Chris' Girlfriends

You must be my best friend's HIgirlfriend. I recognize you from Christopher's phone background, he always has a picture of you there. I'm Ethan, Chris and I went to youth group together and became good friends. I can see why he's so taken with you, you are even livelier in person than in his pictures of you. So you guys took a trip to New York not too long ago, Chris said he had a good time, what about you? 

# Ice Breaker Questions 

* If you were a crayon, what color would you be?
* If you had to choose between lasagna, Mexican lasagna, brats, or tacos, and you could never eat the other three, which would you choose?

# Bible Rhetoric 

* I appeal to you, brothers
* Now I urge you, brethren
* Each of us is to
* I have written very boldly to you on some points so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,
* I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
* Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit,
* Now the God of peace be with you all.

# Pickup Lines

* When God created you He wasn't being very considerate of my lust capacities.
* If it makes you feel any better, I've had dreams about you what made me change my pants after I woke up—no, forgive me, that was a bad thing to say.
* We fit together like the sticky ends of recombinant DNA.
