[What Tate Looks For In A Wife](https://youtube.com/shorts/eqjb19B4QBA?feature=share)

My biggest thing to look for above looks, above even her intellect would be 2 things: If you were to give me a woman who was dedicated to me to the end and I could see it no matter what. I'm the man she wants, she doesn't want anyone else. That's who I would be interested in having a kid with. Because you never know what's going to happen in life, if it all goes wrong for me I can't be sitting in a cell thinking my baby momma is fucking somebody else. The second thing when it comes to having kids with a woman is family. There's always going to be a degree of rebel or a degree of adventure that every man needs to feel satisfied. Once you have a child, if you completely get rid of those things and only live and exist for the baby, and become a second mother, you're going to be very unhappy. You need your time away as a man. If you find a woman from a strong family, where the family unit is strong, you can trust her to take care of the baby.
