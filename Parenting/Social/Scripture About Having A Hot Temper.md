>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
>Knowing
>this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
But let patience have
>her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
>men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
>A double minded man
>is unstable in all his ways.
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
>Blessed
>is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
>Do not err, my beloved brethren.
>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
>therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
>is vain.
Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,
>and to keep himself unspotted from the world.

>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
>Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
>This persuasion
>cometh not of him that calleth you.
A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
>I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
>For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only

 not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
For all the law is fulfilled in one word,
>even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
>But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
>these;
 Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told
>you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
>And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
