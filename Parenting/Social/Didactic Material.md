# 5 Questions Of Evangelism

1. Do you have any kind of spiritual belief's?
2. To you, who is Jesus Christ?
3. Do you believe in Heaven & Hell?
4. If you died, where would you go?
5. If you died today and stood before God, and He asked you why he should let you into heaven, what would you say?

**Philosophy Of No God:** Without God, everything is vanity

# The finitude of a godless universe

There are four fundamental questions of life govern the way that we look at this world. Virtually every serious question can be boiled down to one of these four:

1. Who am I?
2. Where did I come from?
3. Why am I here?
4. Where am I going when I die?

We may not all articulate those questions with those exact words, but in our soul each of us wrestles with those four basic questions. The way we answer these questions depends on our worldview, and if evolution is true, we can answer all four of them.

Philosophical implication number one: Who am I? If evolution is true, we essentially have no identity. We're just accidental by-products of nature which have evolved on an infinitesimal speck of dust lost somewhere in a hostile and mindless universe. We are doomed to perish both individually and collectively, and destined to be transmuted into dark matter. According to this philosophy, a man is merely a part of nature. It does not matter how you live. We have no one to answer to because we are "up from the slime" as Jeffrey Dahmer, notorious serial killer, puts it.

Philosophical implication number two: Where did I come from? If evolution is true, then we are simply the result of an accident. Human freewill does not exist because we are merely a part of nature; we posses neither a spirit nor a soul. The way our brains think is simply the result of chemical reactions. Therefore, there is no point in refraining from any immoral activity for two reasons: The first being that our brains are wired to react a certain way and we have no control over this reaction, and the second being that without God there can be no objective standard of morality, thus morality must be subjective and virtually does not exist. If morality means anything for anyone, it means nothing for everyone.

Philosophical implication number three: Why am I here? If evolution is true, then life is ultimately meaningless. Our lives are simply the result of an accident and it makes no difference how we live. Ultimately it does not matter who we are or what we do, and in the end it makes no difference whether we existed or not. Our lives are inconsequential.

Philosophical implication number four: Where am I going when I die? If evolution is true, then this life is all we have, meaning we have a finite existence, and, therefore, our life is of temporary value. For example, if a person has an apple, it is only of value while it is fresh. As soon as that person finishes eating it, or when it decays, it is no longer of any value. If evolution is true, our lives are no different than that apple.

* Death is the destination of each life. To say death is repulsive is to say the journey of life is vain.

If God does not exist, think of what that entails. Without God, there is no hope for an afterlife; what we are experiencing now, if we can even call it a life in such a case, is all that belongs to us. Consequently, when all is said and done, our lives are meaningless. Why? Because anything with a finite existence has temporary value, or perhaps more accurately, anything with a finite effect is of temporary value. That is to say, if you can measure it (in this case our lives and legacy) in the unit of time, its value is temporary. Anything you do that does not affect eternity will not matter 700 million years from now, and if an eternal God does not exist, it follows that eternity does not exist either.

In the early 1850's, [Rudolf Clausius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius "Rudolf Clausius") discovered what he called his mechanical [theory of heat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_heat "Theory of heat"), now referred to as entropy (Clausius 147-48).  Although the actual process may be complicated to the average layman, its basic concept is quite simple. It refers to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which tells us that the universe's usable energy is slowly deteriorating into what scientists call dark energy (Sychev 68). Not only does this demand that the universe has a finite past, but also that it has a finite future. Astronomers have discovered that everything we can observe (i.e. ordinary matter) is less than five percent of the universe. The rest has already converted into dark matter (twenty-three percent) and dark energy (seventy-two percent) due to entropy (Chui). Therefore, if everything we accomplish in our lives is destined to result in dark energy, its value comes to nothing when entropy claims the remaining five percent of the universe. We can summarize the argument with the following syllogism:

1. Whatever has a finite effect is of temporary value.
2. The universe (i.e. time, space, and matter) is finite.
3. Therefore, if there is nothing outside of time, space, and matter (i.e. God), the value of our lives come to nothing.

Think further about the serious implications of this conclusion. If your life is doomed to end in death, then ultimately it does not matter how you live. In the end it makes no difference whether you existed or not. Sure, you might be able to affect the world around you and the people in it for a finite period of time, but ultimately if there is nothing outside of the physical universe, it all comes down to dark energy and mankind is doomed to perish by the law of entropy. Ultimately it makes no difference who you are or what you do. Your life is inconsequential.

>"Only one life, twill soon be past, only what's done for Christ will last."

# The emptiness of a godless heart

Our human hearts are a lot like our stomachs. We need to keep filling it with all this stuff to fulfill us. We get hungry but we don't really know what we crave, so we fill our hearts with love, pleasure, whatever it is that we think will satisfy us. What is it you're filling your heart with, and is it satisfying you? We all feel stress, we all feel pressure, and we all seek relief. "Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart" (ESV Psalm 37:4).

>"God is most glorified in you when you are most satisfied in Him." ~ John Piper

# The Finitude Of A Name

A name means nothing at all. Look at Albert Einstein, his name is getting all the recognition in the world, but what is he actually gaining from it? Honor? He is not, only the image of his name is receiving honor, which credits him nothing 6 feet below the earth.

Life is a journey, and death is the destination of all who take the journey. Strive not to make life better for others, but direct them in the way to life eternal.

>"Ain't nothing wrong with havin' it. Matter fact, go and get it  /
>But if you find identity in it then go 'n forget it /
>You gain the whole world but lost the only thing ya' own /
>'Cause everything else is just a temporary loan." ~ Lecrae Moore

> [!Bible] 
> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
> 
> 
  Matthew 16:26 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+16:26?translation=kjv)

# Doctrine Of Awareness

**Doctrine Of Awareness:** All men have some degree of awareness that God exists

"For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened" (ESV Romans 1:19-21).

>Most people have a certain awareness of God buried deeply somewhere inside them, but if you want them to find it, you've got to be the one with the shovel.

>"[There] are some clues that the unbelievers that you know have something written on their heart that's a witness to what I'm saying. . . . Why do they go to the Grand Canyon? Why do they take trips to the Rockies? Why do they fly to Switzerland and rent a little Sheila in the Alps? Because when you're standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon, or standing at the foot of the Rockies, you feel small and vulnerable, so why do they go? And not only do they go, but they go into stores and buy big glossy picture books to remind them of their insignificance when they get home. And you know why, if you've been tracking with me at all, you know what that is a whisper of in the human heart. God has not left them without a witness. They were made not for the salvation of self esteem, but for something magnificent, outside themselves. They know it. They know this. They know that the deepest, highest, longest, pleasures they've ever had have not been when they stood in front of a mirror and liked what they saw. That's fun; nobody likes to be unpleasing in front of a mirror, but they know that's so small. But at the edge of the Grand Canyon, when the soul is just drawn out, and for a fleeting, God given moment, they are non-self conscious, and only feel wonder, they have tasted a parable of what they were created for: God." ~ John Piper

>"There are all these things we go to documenting our inferiority [football games, movies, plays, museums, etc], and we go; why? Why do you turn on those games when they're so much better than you are? And it just must make you feel really weak. . . . You go to a museum and you see this magnificent art, and you say, 'I can't even draw a stick figure, so I feel really inferior in this room.' No, no that's not what happens. Why? Because you're being drawn out in some sweet moments of self-forgetfulness to admire greatness. It's just a parable of why we're made. We're not made to feel great about ourselves mainly, we're made to feel great about God mainly. All of these are testimonies in the heart of fallen human beings that they're made for God." ~ John Piper

>"If I've got a tree in the middle of the street, the truth is that there's a tree in the middle of the street and I better turn my car to the right or the left. If I say 'What really matters to me is that. . . . I don't want to feel that there's a tree there, that's not meaningful to me.' Then the tree will kill you, cause you'll just go right into the tree. Now I think that most people believe in the physical level that some things are true and some things are false. Whereas I think when it comes to the moral and spiritual, people say 'Well it's up to you to decide whether it's right or wrong for you.' Christianity says that there's more cohesion between the physical and the spiritual realm." ~ Timothy Keller

# The Philosophy Of God

**The Philosophy Of God:** Sinners will be cast into eternal fire

"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels' " (ESV Matthew 25:41).

"when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might" (ESV 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9).

"The wicked shall return to Sheol, all the nations that forget God" (ESV Psalm 9:17).

"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?" (ESV 1 Corinthians 6:9).

"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil." (ESV 2 Corinthians 5:10).

"Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?" (ESV Romans 6:16).

"For the wages of sin is death" (ESV Romans 6:23).

"Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire" (Revelation 20:11-15).

# Doctrine Of Sinners

**Doctrine Of Sinners:** No one is righteous before the Lord

"as it is written: 'None is righteous, no, not one' " (ESV Romans 3:10).

"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (ESV Romans 3:23).

"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us" (ESV 1 John 1:8).

". . . . no one living is righteous before you" (ESV Psalm 143:2).

"For by works of the law no human being will be justified in His sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin" (ESV Romans 3:20).

* "You cannot present your contaminated pre-Christian moral efforts or post-Christian contaminated Holy Spirit wrought efforts to God as sufficient for why He should accept you. He's not impressed with contaminated obedience." ~ John Piper (Romans 3:20)

"You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. (Matthew 5:21-22)

"You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell. (Matthew 5:27-30)

* You can't understand the significance of the cross without the perception of your own guilt.

# Doctrine Of Jesus

**Doctrine Of Jesus:** He is Lord and Savior

"The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost" (ESV 1 Timothy 1:15).

"He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?' Simon Peter replied, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.' And Jesus answered him, 'Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven' " (ESV Matthew 16:15-17).

"The woman said to him, 'I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.' Jesus said to her, 'I who speak to you am he' " (ESV John 4:25-26).

"So they all said, 'Are you the Son of God, then?' And he said to them, 'You say that I am' " (ESV Luke 22:70).

"For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ" (ESV Romans 5:17).

# Doctrine Of Grace

**Doctrine Of Grace:** Righteousness is given to those who believe

"Jesus answered them, 'This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent' " (ESV John 6:29).

"I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose." (ESV Galatians 2:21).

But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction" (ESV Romans 3:21-22).

". . . . I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith (ESV Philippians 3:8-9).

"And now all the righteous will be humble" (MLT The Book Of Enoch 10.17).

**To die in your sins is to rely on your own righteousness**

>"It doesn't matter what you believe, if you die in your sins you go to hell." ~ Ray Comfort

To believe in the Son is the righteousness of God, and sin is unbelief. What you believe determines your sin. Sin is the prison that leads to death, but the gift of God is eternal life.

# A Generation Of Righteousness

"And I saw written on them that generation after generation will do evil, until a generation rises up and does righteousness." That generation was the generation of acts chapter 2, when the Holy Spirit descended from Heaven. After that there was this Jesus culture, and man started to stand before God not in wickedness, but in righteousness. "And the righteous will be humble," because all of our righteousness is not our own, but from God. No one can boast about their contaminated Spirit wrought efforts at righteousness, because just like in Isaiah's day, all of our righteousness is as filthy rags.

>"The gospel is about a righteousness that doesn't go up _to_ God, but comes down _from_ God." ~ Louie Giglio

**Doctrine Of Salvation****:** It is by grace through faith that anyone is saved

> [!Bible] 
> Jesus answered and said unto him,
>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 
> 
  [John 3:3 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/John+3:3?translation=kjv)

> [!Bible] 
> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. 
> 
  [Matthew 11:28-30 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+11:28-30?translation=kjv)

"if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved" (ESV Romans 10:9-10).

"For 'everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved' " (ESV Romans 10:13).

"For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast" (ESV Ephesians 2:8-9).

"For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law" (ESV Romans 3:28).

"And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works: 'Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin' " (ESV Romans 4:5-8).

"All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation" (ESV 2 Corinthians 5:18-19).

"There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (ESV Romans 8:1).

"But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace" (Romans 11:6).

"he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit" (ESV Titus 3:5).

"In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit" (ESV Ephesians 1:13).

"And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee" (ESV 2 Corinthians 1:21-22).

"But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God" (ESV John 1:12).

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" (ESV John 3:16).

"Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God" (ESV John 3:18). This is what determines whose names will be written in the book of life.

"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life" (ESV John 6:47).

"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life" (ESV John 5:24).

"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness' " (ESV Matthew 7:21-23).

"For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day" (ESV John 6:40).

# Doctrine Of Discipleship

**Doctrine Of Discipleship:** Following Jesus is difficult

"Then Jesus told his disciples, 'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it' " (ESV Matthew 16:24-25).

"And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me" (ESV Matthew 10:38).

"If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you" (ESV John 15:19).

"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple" (ESV Luke 14:26).

"I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world" (ESV John 16:33).

And he said to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest" (ESV Luke 10:2).

And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men" (ESV Matthew 4:19).

"Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few" (ESV Matthew 7:13-14).

"Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" (ESV Matthew 11:28-29).

>"The reason that the way is hard, is because it is a struggle to believe that it's easy. If we trusted Him fully, it would be easy. But faith is a fight. Paul says, "I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith, I have finished my course. (2 Timothy 4:7) What's he fighting? He's not fighting to perform for God, that's works. He's fighting to trust Him." ~ John Piper.

>"Discipleship is not an offer that man makes to Christ." ~ [Dietrich Bonhoeffer](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29333.Dietrich_Bonhoeffer)

# To Die Is Gain

Approaching our seats for the final camp service Gabe Philpot slapped my leg. Starting a friendly competition I slapped his leg back. He slapped mine again and it continued back and forth until I realized I wasn't paying attention to the speaker. In an effort to focus on his message I accepted the humility of defeat and desisted to slap him back. A minute later he slapped me again, when I looked over at him, he whispered, "I won." Still attempting to attend my deliberation to the speaker, I replied, "Okay," and with hesitation remarked, "But you get no prize for it." Necessitating to sustain his pride he said, "I still won." But in truth, where was actual victory? In the one who achieved the last slap, or the one who laid aside the distraction of his pride to learn something from the speaker's message? Gabe had nothing to gain by executing the last slap, but in fact, only by putting that distraction (and victory) to death was profit.

# Testimony Scriptures

"The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance" (ESV 2 Peter 3:9).

"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (ESV Romans 6:23).

"but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (ESV Romans 5:8).

"for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything" (ESV 1 John 3:20).

"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come" (ESV 2 Corinthians 5:17).

# Never fabricate the gospel to make it sound appealing

Multiplying Christianity isn't selling a product. It's putting to death those who accept the gospel for what it is, not for how good you can make it sound. Unless you are willing to give up everything you treasure, you cannot be a disciple of Christ. Don't ever lead someone to blindly follow him. To bear fruit, you must count the cost.

# Doctrine Of The Testimony

**Doctrine Of The Testimony:** Not our words, but only God's Spirit will save

"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day" (ESV John 6:44).

"I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth" (ESV 1 Corinthians 3:6-7).

"Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict" (ESV Luke 21:14-15).

"in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame" (ESV 1 Peter 3:15-16).

# 5 Ways To Describe the Gospel
>"Let me outline five ways that to describe the gospel:
>
>1. You can describe the gospel, in the Bible, in terms of events, or **a central event** (the death or Christ; the resurrection of Christ).
>2. You can describe the gospel in terms of **the achievement of the event** (What happened when the event happened in the heavenly places, between Christ and God. I mean an objective achievement before anything happens in your heart. You weren't even there).
>3. Third: the gospel can be spoken of in terms of **the offer of the achievement** to you and how it's offered (is it offered to works or faith?).
>4. Forth: You can describe the gospel in terms of **its application to your heart** (that is, the achievement two-thousand years ago becomes yours, and you experience something between you and God because of what Christ did before you were ever born. That would be the application of the gospel event and achievement).
>5. And finally you get to what this whole conference is about. All of that, I'm arguing, is intended to get you to **God**. And if you don't get to God, none of that is good news." ~ John Piper

# Doctrine Of Servitude

**Doctrine Of Servitude:** Serve as though you are serving the Lord

"whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen" (ESV 1 Peter 4:11).

"not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or is free" (ESV Ephesians 6:6-8).

"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ" (ESV Colossians 3:23-24).

>Serving God isn't determined by how much work you get done, but by the smile you're serving with.

# The Hope Of God

On the other hand, if God does exist, we have hope, meaning, and identity. We have hope that when our lives inevitably end, we will not cease to live:

"When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: 'Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?' The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (ESV 1 Corinthians 15:54-57).

We have meaning in that we are fearfully and wonderfully made for the glory of God; "bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth, everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made" (ESV Isaiah 43:6-7). Our purpose and duties are made clear in the scriptures: "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil" (ESV Ecclesiastes 12:13-14). We have identity in Christ, as Paul writes, "if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come" (ESV 2 Corinthians 5:17), "[b]ut to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God" (ESV John 1:12).

Therefore, it makes a life-changing difference whether or not God exists. Even if the evidence for and against the existence of God were absolutely equal, the rational thing to do, I think, is to believe in Him. That is to say, it seems to me positively irrational when the evidence is equal to prefer death, futility, and despair over hope, meaningfulness and happiness.

# It does no good to choose a good road that leads to a place of death

The road of euphoria leads to the pit of depression. Many take the route because of the scenery and pay no regard to where it is taking them. In the end, they will never be satisfied. Little by little the trees start fading, and the plants start dying, and before you know it you're in such a barren place that all you desire is to get out, but you have no direction anymore. The tears of euphoria never stop falling, and regret stays with you, even from the beginning. You call out for help, but no one can hear. But whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. He offers a pathway that leads out of the place where euphoria takes you, but the path is narrow, and very undesirable.

# False Dichotomy Of Salvation By Faith Or Works

We do a lot to make sure everyone knows our salvation is by faith and not works. We create this simple dichotomy to make the Lord's salvation easy for the layman to understand. Yet, when we talk about salvation by faith or salvation by works, are they not the same thing? I don't mean in the sense that when you have faith, works will come. Isn't faith itself the work of God? Yes, my salvation comes by works, yet faith is the work by which it comes. "For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you," says the Lord, "neither is it far off." Salvation is by works; the works of God. It's a vile mistake to misrepresent the gospel in order to simplify it for those who hear it, that they might receive it. "I planted," Paul says, "And Apollos watered, but God made it grow." The gospel cannot be received by means of human effort, but only by the Holy Spirit who empowers one to plant, another to water, and finally the seed to grow. "not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith" (Philippians 3:9, ESV).

* If you died today and stood before God, and He asked you why he should let you into heaven, what would you say? #imyours

* To properly dismiss an idea, you must first consider it.

* Acknowledging your sin but refusing to heed correction isn't repentance, that's feeling sorry. Remorse won't get you anywhere further than where you are.

* The difference between dissatisfied people and satisfied people is not where they are in life, but where they're looking in life. You can look up, or look down, but where you are is irrelevant.

* If the judgment of man makes you weary, how much more the judgment of God?

* It's not about the numbers, it's about the difference.

* We're not there to impress them with our biblical knowledge, we're there to impress on them biblical truth.

# Luke 15

Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them."

So he told them this parable: "What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.

"Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.' Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents."

And he said, "There was a man who had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.' And he divided his property between them. Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything.

"But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants."' And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to celebrate.

"Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.' But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, but he answered his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!' And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'"

Equipping The Believer

## Todd White Teaching

If you understand who God is as a father, you'll just want him.

God says in Isaiah, I just read this, Isaiah 26:3 I think it is, that God will keep in perfect peace He who sets his mind on Him because he trusts in Him. But if you can't set your mind on Him because you don't trust in Him, you have no peace. You never will have peace. Listen, in the gospel Jesus came to give us a peace that surpasses understanding. (s16e11m05)

### Bible

So many times we go to prayer, and we don't feel anything in that place, we're like, "I'm praying, but I'm not feeling it," and so, "I tried it," and like, "I'll just go listen to other people teach me and maybe I'll grow that way. That's not good for you. So what if I told you that the whole Christian life is birthed in the quiet place, in the secret place, when no one's looking. I mean it's what the Bible says. But sometimes we go into that secret place and we're not feeling anything there, we're like trying to seek him and it's like, "I don't feel like you're here, I don't feel like you're there, man I don't know what to do, so I'm just going to pull up somebody on YouTube and watch their video so I can grow closer to the father." … continue … That's the wrong dad that's saying that. (s16e11m06)
