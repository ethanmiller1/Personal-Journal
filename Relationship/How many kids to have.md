If I had 3 kids I would be happy. But I still want to talk about it. The argument isn't to threaten your preference. Only you can change your mind, I will never force that. And I am always willing to change my mind, but I want to be convinced that 5 is the perfect number for a family. And I want us to talk about it, and explore our feelings because I find psychology very interesting.
 

Why wouldn't we want more kids?
-   Maybe other people will judge us.
    
-   Maybe 3 will be like the 3 Musketeers, but a forth will feel left out.
    
-   Maybe too many kids will force us to spend less time with each, making them all less special.
    
-   Maybe it's too much work.
    
-   Maybe you want a career, so we can't have too many kids.
    
-   It's very expensive. Maybe kids can't have a cell phone.
    

  

Here's why I think we should have kids:
-   Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.
    
-   She shall be saved in child bearing.
    
-   Women should be occupied at home, not at work. Men should pay 100% of the expenses.
    
-   More playmates for each other.
    
-   Happier, louder, fuller house.
    
-   More tax returns.
    
-   Forces kids to learn to get along.
    


If you don't find those reasons convincing, that's totally fine. But at least we said everything we want to say so that we're not secretly begrudging it later on. If you were right about seafood, maybe you are right about other things.
