There is a popular idea that asking someone to change is contrary to the virtue of accepting them as they are.  The term "Virtue" shall mean accepting someone as they are.

[Sabrina Carpenter - Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhH4pbRJh0k) is saturated with this same belief, suggesting that their relationship works well in part because neither party asks the other to change.

There is another essential virtue, which is allowing people to become the best versions of themselves possible. [Josh Fluke](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaFluke1) tells the story of when he first started recording YouTube videos, and he excitedly showed his wife, and his wife stared at him and said, "That's not you." He thought, "What if it's who I want to be? And for 15 minutes I get to be." That video is the embodiment of his goals, but the people around us tend to lock us into the person we are instead of allowing us to continuously improve.

> No family is really functional. You don't choose your family. It's just a group of random people where familiarity is breeding so much contempt and everybody knows each other's peculiarities, their little idiosyncrasies and it's just very difficult sometimes.

In this dissertation, I will argue that accepting someone as they are without pushing them to strive for bettering themselves is an anti-virtue, and it is preferable to be with someone who will point out your blind spots, motivate you to reach for the next finish line, and never stop working on yourself. These qualities can coexist with loving someone as they are, accept them without the changes that you petition for, and having a fully symbiotic, whole relationship.

# The example of Jesus and the Church

The first premise of my argument will be that it is how the Bible treats our relationship with Jesus. <mark class="hltr-yellow">Jesus accepts us as we are, but he doesn't leave us as we are</mark>. He says:

> [!Bible] 
> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. 
> 
  [Matthew 5:48 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Matthew+5:48?translation=kjv)

John Piper in his sermon series "[Who Is This Divided Man?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKDNT4SUi-o)" shows that the Christian both struggles with sin while Jesus has set them free from sin.

> [!Bible] 
> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
> 
> 
  [Romans 7:23-24 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+7:23-24?translation=kjv)

> [!Bible] 
> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
> 
> 
  [Romans 8:2 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Romans+8:2?translation=kjv)

Jesus says we are unleavened, and uses that as the motivation to get the leaven out of our lives:

> [!Bible] 
> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
> 
> 
  [1 Corinthians 5:7 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/1Corinthians+5:7?translation=kjv)


There are different categories of things that a person may ask you to change.
* Sins
* Preferences
* Taste
* Interests
* Bad habits

If someone asks you to change a sin, that isn't being toxic. If someone asks you to change a preference, that is more complicated. If you like sports, and your husband doesn't, and he asks you to stop liking them because he doesn't like it, that is an immature request. But if he identifies that you are spending all your time watching games and preferring them over quality time with him, he may ask you to prioritize other things above watching sports, and that would be reasonable.

The reason you want to get married instead of cohabitate is because you are locked in. If you can leave at any time, you will never tell each other the truth, and you need to tell each other the truth to keep each other from becoming strange and eccentric. You want to be with someone who makes you better, not someone who accepts you lounging around on a couch all day and enables you to continue in a lower quality life than God has called you to.
