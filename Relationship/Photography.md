## Adventure
Nude photography is deeper than having something to wank off to. There is a primal instinct we all have to do something risky. Skinny dipping in duck creek, riding a roller coaster, skydiving, having sex in a risky public spot. The adrenaline rush that comes with those moments of adventure make you feel something profound. You're never as alive as you are in those moments. Your awareness is heightened, your heart is pumping, you get a kick of chemicals in your brain that make you feel loose and happy and alive. That's one aspect of nude photography. But it's more than that.

## Art
Nude photography has an art to it. You pay attention to the lighting, the aperture, the depth perception, the background, the positions, the angles, and you want to capture something beautiful, and what is more beautiful than the naked body of your wife? You are working together to create something beautiful and artistic.

## Intimate
So there's an adrenaline aspect, and a creational aspect. It's something risky, and it's something artistic. It's something that you worked to create, and at the end of the effort you have a collection of art that is intimate and secret between the two of you.

## Confident
There's also a sense of wanting your wife to be comfortable in her own skin. There's something sexy about a woman who's not afraid to get naked, and likes to feel sexy. It's a huge turn on, and something I want.
