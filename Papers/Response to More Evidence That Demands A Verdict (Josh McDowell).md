# Critical Analysis of "More Evidence that Demands a Verdict" by Josh McDowell (Notes)

"If McDowell expects critics and skeptics to accept archeology as evidence that the bible is an accurate history and therefore the word of God, then he needs evidence for incredible events like these \[events of Devine Intervention, such as the parting of the red sea, the handing down of the ten commandments, etc\], because these are the events that demand our skepticism, not the relatively plausible details of the biblical narrative." - [Steve Shives](http://www.youtube.com/user/stevelikes2curse)

McDowell counters an argument that the Israelite people were too primitive to have written such a complex law (or even write at all for that matter), during the time of Moses, with the Code of Hammurabi, dating 300 to 600 years before the law of Moses, quoting sources that confirm the code's complexity, and similarity to the Hebrew laws. But as soon as he makes his point, he has to fill in a hole that he's dug for himself, because now the critic can make an argument that since the Code of Hammurabi predates the Hebrew laws and share similar rules, the law of Moses is derived from the Code of Hammurabi. He quotes someone saying that the Code of Hammurabi might've been a corrupted version of God's law revealed to that people, but I don't think that's a very compelling argument to the critic.

As a Christian, I believe some of God's laws existed before he revealed them to Moses, as we see Noah distinguishing between clean and unclean animals (and certainly some laws came later, such as pass over which was dependant on God's history with the Israelite people, which is also the root of the sacrifices of the first born, because when He killed the all the first born in Egypt, He sanctified all the first born in Israel to Himself, and ended up trading them for the Levites), but skeptics are open to criticize this argument as relying on Christian presuppositions.

One who believes in the Son cannot adhere to the documentary theory. McDowell notes abundant references from the Pentateuch, the books of the prophets and the writings, and from the New Testament that credits Moses as the author of the Pentateuch.

 But to an agnostic, that's absolutely no help because such references are not held to be authoritative. So [[Response to More Evidence That Demands A Verdict (Josh McDowell)#Comment 1|to the Christian, there can be no alternative to the Mosaic authorship of the books of the law]] ; either it's true that Moses wrote them, or their faith is based on a book filled with errors, lies, or bottom line, Jesus, Paul, David, and the bible overall was wrong, and therefore cannot be a cornerstone for Christian religion.

But McDowell gives external evidence for the Mosaic authorship as well, yet the agnostic can argue that his arguments seem to be from other sources and writings who have accepted the Bible as true. (......duh. You're not going to find anyone claiming Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch that don't believe in the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.) McDowell basically points out that it has been widely accepted that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, and that Wellhausen's Documentary Theory was the first to claim otherwise, [[Response to More Evidence That Demands A Verdict (Josh McDowell)#Comment 2|but he doesn't actually provide any evidence to satisfy historical investigation]]. He provides neither written testimony, because the writings he cites weren't actually there to testify, they have no basis or qualifications for their testimony, the same applying to the oral testimony that he cites, and to my knowledge there was no physical evidence. So to the agnostic, I feel this is a weak argument to refute the Documentary Theory.

"McDowell breaks the Bible up into separate books when he wants to use part of it to confirm another part, but when he's establishing the historicity of the Bible using archeological evidence it becomes a monolith again and evidence for the truth of the most mundane plausible passage is expected to establish the truth of the whole thing; miracles and talking snakes and all." - Steve Shives

The only acceptable witness that would be considered a qualified source to testify of the events in the Pentateuch, is someone who was actually there. Therefore, the only testimony we can historically conclude as indicative of the authorship of the Pentateuch, is the Pentateuch itself, which as McDowell notes, clearly states certain portions of its contents were written by Moses. Therefore, by the witness of the only document that's qualifies to testify of the Pentateuch's author, there is no reason to deny the Mosaic authorship of it.

If the Bible is a naturally developed book (The Documentary Hypothesis), then it is subject to human error and fantasy. The only reason to believe in the Word of God, is if the Bible, which proclaims the Word of God, is absolutely true. It must be a supernaturally developed book if it holds any value to the Christian other than its value as a literary work.

Chapter 11, which discusses the use of divine names is probably my favorite chapter in this book.

"It's not the contradictions that indicate multiple sources, it's the existence of two accounts." - Steve Shives

McDowell refutes the argument that the Pentateuch couldn't have been written by Moses because it includes the use of words that didn't exist during the time of Moses by suggesting that the scribes of antiquity replaced an earlier proper name by its later form. This seems to be a reasonable claim, although it would bother me knowing that the Pentateuch was changed by the scribes. If the document is the product of a modernized transcription, I'd hate to think of what might've been lost, added, or altered. However, I'd have to make assumptions to worry about any significant changes in the manuscript.

McDowell admits that the copies of the Bible we have today are not inherent. He asserts that [[Response to More Evidence That Demands A Verdict (Josh McDowell)#Comment 3|the original autograph were the truly perfect version, but the manuscripts we have today contain a few mistakes as a result of copyist errors]]. The copyist's at some point through the line made a mistake.

"I have shown in my book how you can take these manuscripts and you can recreate the new testament that what you have is what was written down to a 99.5% pure text." - Josh McDowell

"McDowell and Bruce claim that Luke is rigidly accurate in areas where he can be tested and for that reason we should accept those more preposterous details; we should give Luke the benefit of the doubt. I contend that those miracles of Jesus comprise an area where we can test Luke. I don't think we just have to accept those based on the areas that we can test. I think those are part of the area that we can test. Do we have any archeological evidence that we can refer to when thinking about these miracles? Well no, we have none. Do we have any extra-biblical records of the miracles that we can refer to? Again, no, but we do have our everyday common, quantifiable, describable, widely agreed upon, experiences; we have a scientific understanding of how the world works, of what does and does not happen, of what, from all appearances, can and cannot happen. And the Miracles of Jesus, the healings, the casting out of demons, the feeding of crowds of people with tiny amounts of food, the command over the weather, the resurrection, the ascension, all of these things belong in the category of things that are never observed to happen. They do not, and almost certainly cannot happen." - Steve Shives

"As to impartiality, I would argue that unbiased historians do treat Jesus in the same way that they treat Julius Caesar, or Alexander the Great, or any other ancient figure who we know existed but around him a legend has grown. Julius Caesar is universally accepted to have actually existed, we have sources for the life of Caesar that are treated as very dependable. But nobody seriously believes that Caesar is descended from the goddess Aphrodite through her son the legendary hero Animus. And Alexander the Great is likewise accepted as a real and significant historical figure, but no one today seriously thinks that his true father was Zeus. These are legendary stories that have been written and told about these historical figures, yet have been filtered out by historians. We can see that this is myth, this is legend, and we filter it out. We reject is as history. That is the same thing that is done with Jesus, the problem is, there's not much else left after we take out the legend and the myth." - Steve Shives

## Comment 1

 As a Christian, because I believe in the accurate historicity of the four Gospels, and the letters of Paul among the other apostles, since they and Jesus affirmed that the Pentateuch was written by Moses, and I believe in the authority of their word (that is to say, his Word), the books of the law had to have been written by Moses. If I don't believe in the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch than I denigrate the authority of those who have asserted so.

## Comment 2

 However, this is controversial because the only evidence  of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch is the Pentateuch itself.  Every other piece of historical evidence would rely on the basis of common belief.

## Comment 3

 Understanding that there is no "version" of God's Word in all of its glory written on paper in the world today, leads me to disregard if there ever was an inherent copy of God's Word in written form. I've always held that the Bible in itself is not the Word of God, but rather proclaims the Word of God, although not in its entirety. God promises to preserve his word, and if our copies today contain even one mistake, that makes God out to be a liar if we hold that the Bible is in itself God's Word.
