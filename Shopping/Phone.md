# iPhone 13 Pro

## Buy vs. Upgrade Program

![[IMG_0028.png]]

`$62.41/mo * 24mo = $1,497.84`. The only catch is that every time I upgrade, it locks me into another 12 months which equals **$748.92**. I get apple care included, which is $12 a month, which is **$144** a year.

I assume I will upgrade every 2 years a most, and every 3 years at least.

After 6 years:
| Buying Period | Total cost after 6 years | Cost After selling for 70% value |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| $1300/2 years | $3,900                   | <mark class="hltr-yellow">$2,730</mark>                          |
| $1300/3 years | $2,600                   | $2,210                           |
| $62.41/mo     | $4,493.52                | $4,493                           |

The Apple iPhone Upgrade plan is the most expensive, but compared to purchasing a phone every 2 years, it's only 15% more to keep up with the latest iPhone and includes Apple Care as well as theft and loss protection, because you don't own it.

The main reason not to go with that plan is for exactly that reason: **you don't own it**. If I sell me iPhone 14 Pro for $800 after 2 years, I effectively buy the iPhone 16 Pro for $500 instead of $1,500. If I have the abilities to easily sell my phone without much stress, it is absolutely more worth it to own the phone than to buy into Apple's Upgrade Program.

## Upgrade to the Pro Max? Yes!

After using the iPhone 13 Pro for a few months, I wish I had purchased the iPhone 13 Pro Max. The extra screen would be nice when viewing movies on the plane, watching YouTube Videos, viewing pictures. taking pictures, working, navigating the web, etc.
