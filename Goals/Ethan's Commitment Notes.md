## Scripture Typer

Split up verse into short clauses and repeat them 100 or so times until it's ingrained in your mind. String the clauses together at the end.

## Sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs

> [!Bible] 
> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord
>is.
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
> 
> 
  [Ephesians 5:17-21 - KJV](https://bible-api.com/Ephesians+5:17-21?translation=kjv)

# I am wise and pleasant

## Don't be so sarcastic

## Use kind rhetoric

> [!Bible] 
> Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
>And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
> 
>

## Smile

is as a cloud of the latter rain.
