# What is BodyTalk?

The premise of BodyTalk is that the body contains all the information and abilities to heal itself in the vast majority of cases.

The reality is that so many people have individual parts healthy but their wellbeing, and their general health, and their general feeling of comfort of life is very uncompromised in this day and age.

# Innate (Intuitive) Wisdom

During mitosis 23 homologous pairs (46 chromosomes) come together to form a single eukaryotic cell<sup>1</sup> called the zygote.<sup>2</sup> Cytokinesis is the word we use to talk about cell division, when the single cell is divided to form two daughter cells,<sup>3</sup> and the process of a new life begins. We also call this process cleavage, because the parent cells are cleaved to form a new daughter cell. One becomes two, two become four, all the way to sixty-four cells,<sup>4</sup> when it finally starts to become multicellular. Then some of those cells become the brain, some become the kidney, some become the intestines, and some the skin. Each cell knows exactly where to go and how to start multiplying and in what direction. When Dr. John Veltheim was a student in class learning about how this all occurs he raised his hand and said, "Excuse me, but how did the cells know where to go? And why do they even go in the first place?" And the teacher looked at him and said, "In this type of subject you do not ask how or why. You just ask what." They're willing to describe what's going on, but Bodytalk's objective is to try and understand how a bunch of cells knew what to do to create one of the most complex structures, the human body, in such a short time. Pain is another question. Pain tells us we have a problem. The body is saying, "No, you shouldn't walk on that broken leg." The key word here is intuition.
