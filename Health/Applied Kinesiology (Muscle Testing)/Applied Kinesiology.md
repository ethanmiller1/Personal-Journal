The skepticism in applied kinesiology is very much grounded in an unfamiliarity with it. If you ask the skeptic, "What is it in AK that you don't believe? Is it the anatomy? The neurology? The physiology? The pathology? The biochemistry?"

Muscle testing takes a look at the excitatory inputs that are going into the nervous system and all of the [[Applied Kinesiology#Comment 1|inhibitory inputs]] that are going into the nervous system. When you take the net sum of inputs, do you have more positive? W either want the muscle function to test strong or to be inhibited. For example when you're walking and your right arm is going forward, the flexors of the arm are going to be facilitated, but at the same time the lower trapezius actually have to inhibit to allow me to life up the arm. All of those excitatory and inhibitory factors are being added up and subtracted by the nervous system, which allows us to have function. Muscle testing is just measuring the net response of those positive and negative factors that are coming in the anterior horn at the motor neurons in the spinal cord. It isn't a measure of gross muscle strength.

AK measures more than just muscle responses. It tests range of motion, grip strength, changes in pain, changes in blood pressure, and eye vision.

5 Factors of AK

1.       A Nerve (N)

Every muscle has nerve functions, whether it's from the brain all the way down the spinal cord to the verve roots.

2.      A Lymphatic Vessel (NL)

The lymphatic system is the sewer system of the body. It's the bodies way of getting rid of junk. Every muscle has lymphatic tissue (lymph nodes). Sometimes the body will not be able to get rid of it as efficiently causing the muscles to bathe in its own waste material, which neurologically and systematologically causes the body to inhibit and shut off.

3.      A Blood Vessel (NV)

Every muscle has a blood supply.

4.      An Acupuncture Meridian Connector (AMC)

Every muscle has an acupuncture meridian connector (energy pathways).

5.      Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF)

His can be thought of as the nutrition to the nervous system.

-         Nutrition / Chemical Imbalances
-         Psychological Stressors

The stimulus has to get to the nervous system in order in order to cause a reflex. It doesn't do anything to hold it in your hand or merely think about it (this is not scientific), but when you put a stimulus in the mouth on the tongue, it's in the nervous system instantly. When you put tobacco sauce in your mouth it's instantly in your nervous system. Your hair stands up a little bit on your arms, your pupils dilate, your lungs begin to expand, and that's how quickly it's in your nervous system which is why we can muscle test it. Ultimately it's going to go to your Thelma, your cortex, your poll sensual gyrus to the insula for taste sensation, and in the other direction towards the hypothomes.

The body speaks volumes. AK is a sort of linguistic art. If a person is half naked sitting on an igloo, the body is going to in a very smart way take blood from the extremities and bring it to the core to keep yourself warm. Your body doesn't care at this point about keeping your fingers warm. That's the intelligence of the body. Medicine doesn't recognize this intelligence in the body. A doctor might give you medication saying, "Hmm, the body is pulling your blood to the lower extremities." Well no, the body is doing what it's doing for a reason. Medication presupposes that the body is stupid and doesn't know what it's doing, which has no empirical basis. Generalization is always the product of a technician, not a doctor. A doctor doesn't treat every case with the same think, he asks, "Why is the body doing what it's doing?" And gets to the heart of the issue.

If you're not going to the bathroom very well, part of the detox mechanism ends up in the skin instead of the toilet since your skin is the largest excretory organ in your body, so maybe they'll have rashes or ache, or some kind of dermatitis.

1.       What stimuli is causing the inputs?
2.       What are the inputs themselves? (i.e. cell communication)
