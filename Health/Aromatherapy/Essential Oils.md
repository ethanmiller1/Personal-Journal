The scientists say this anger pathway provides insight into [unconscious human behavior](http://www.livescience.com/11337-top-10-mysteries-mind.html).<sup>1</sup>

# Efficacy

## Positive Results

Aromatic scents and oils used in clinical aromatherapy can be beneficial for symptom management such as pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, agitation with dementia, cancer pain, and end of life symptoms, Clinical aromatherapy has been found beneficial in the inpatient and outpatient settings especially critical care, oncology, palliative care, hospice, and surgical. On the flip side, <mark class="hltr-red">aromatic essential oils can be dangerous and toxic due to certain oils being flammable, causing skin dermatitis</mark>, or being phototoxic, with risks of chemical burn, oral toxicity, and even death (Farrar 2020).

The emotional and behavioral stress levels of 28 patients were evaluated pre- and post-treatment on two consecutive days. The therapeutic effects of the two lavenders appeared to be different: one was almost twice as effective as the other, thereby disproving the hypothesis that aromatherapy, using topical application of essential oils, is effective purely because of touch, massage or placebo (Buckle 1993).

## Negative Results

The hypothesis that it is effective for any other indication is not supported by the findings of rigorous clinical trials (Cooke 2000).
