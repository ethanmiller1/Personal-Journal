Most young people are only interested in health benefits that **improve** their quality of life, as opposed to those that **preserve** the health quality they currently posses. A person is relatively uninterested in eating something unpleasant to prevent hair loss if he doesn't suffer from hair loss. The catch 22 is that by the time we discover we are suffering from a health condition, it is already too late to prevent it in many cases. Therefore I will do research to gather natural nutritional hacks that have preventative health benefits so that my children can feel their best possible selves, and look their best. I don't care how they look, but there will come a day that they will care how they look, and I don't want them to resent me for not taking care of their nutritional life and causing greasy skin with large pores, hair loss, fine lines on the forehead, pronounces nasolabial folds, nerd neck, bad posture, or any other visual impediments to their confidence. #parentingmotivation
