### Results

There was no significant difference in any of the demographic characteristics, baseline COPD, or clinical data between the two treatment groups (OV and V). <mark class="hltr-yellow">The URTI incidence rate was significantly higher in group V than in group OV (2.9 versus 1.2 episodes/1000 treatment days</mark>, difference OV–V = −1.7; _p_=0.0312). There was a significant delay in occurrence of an URTI episode in the OV group versus the V group (mean ± standard error: 48.7 ± 3.0 _versus_ 67.0 ± 2.8 days, respectively; _p_=0.0158). <mark class="hltr-red">Limitations to this study include its small population size and the self-recording by patients of the number and duration of URTIs and exacerbations</mark>.

### Conclusion

Oscillococcinum may decrease the incidence rate and delay the appearance of URTIs in patients with COPD.

### Main results

Seven studies were included in the review, three prevention trials (number of participants (n) = 2265) and four treatment trials (n = 1194). Only two studies reported sufficient information to complete data extraction fully. <mark class="hltr-yellow">There was no evidence that homoeopathic treatment can prevent influenza‐like syndrome</mark> (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 1.43). Oscillococcinum treatment <mark class="hltr-yellow">reduced the length of influenza illness by 0.28 days</mark> (95% CI 0.50 to 0.06). Oscillococcinum also increased the chances that a patient considered treatment to be effective (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.00).

### Authors' conclusions

<mark class="hltr-green">Though promising, the data were not strong enough to make a general recommendation</mark> to use Oscillococcinum for first‐line treatment of influenza and influenza‐like syndromes. <mark class="hltr-green">Further research is warranted</mark> but the required sample sizes are large. Current evidence does not support a preventative effect of Oscillococcinum‐like homeopathic medicines in influenza and influenza‐like syndromes.

### Main results

No new trials were included in this 2014 update. We included six studies: two prophylaxis trials (327 young to middle‐aged adults in Russia) and four treatment trials (1196 teenagers and adults in France and Germany). <mark class="hltr-yellow">The overall standard of trial reporting was poor</mark> and hence many important methodological <mark class="hltr-yellow">aspects of the trials had unclear risk of bias</mark>. There was no statistically significant difference between the effects of Oscillococcinum® and placebo in the prevention of influenza‐like illness: risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.34, P value = 0.16. Two treatment trials (judged as 'low quality') reported sufficient information to allow full data extraction: 48 hours after commencing treatment, there was an absolute risk reduction of 7.7% in the frequency of symptom relief with Oscillococcinum® compared with that of placebo (risk difference (RD) 0.077, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.12); the RR was 1.86 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.73; P value = 0.001). A significant but lesser effect was observed at three days (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.56; P value = 0.03), and no significant difference between the groups was noted at four days (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; P value = 0.10) or at five days (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16; P value = 0.25). One of the six studies reported one patient who suffered an adverse effect (headache) from taking Oscillococcinum®.

### Authors' conclusions

<mark class="hltr-yellow">There is insufficient good evidence to enable robust conclusions to be made about Oscillococcinum® in the prevention or treatment of influenza and influenza‐like illness</mark>. <mark class="hltr-green">Our findings do not rule out the possibility that Oscillococcinum® could have a clinically useful treatment</mark> effect but, given the low quality of the eligible studies, the evidence is not compelling. There was no evidence of clinically important harms due to Oscillococcinum®.

### Abstract

Contrasting opinions still exist about the efficacy of Oscillococcinum®, the most famous homeopathic remedy from Boiron Laboratoires, Lyon (F), which is commonly used for flu, season colds and airway inflammatory affections. This popular homeopathic medicine is scarcely supported by clinical and pharmacological evidence and, therefore, further investigations are needed to assess its supposed efficacy in flu. While a cutting Editorial from Weissman in 2006, sought to make fun of this homeopathic medicine for the flu, because it is made from the liver and heart of a duck [1](https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(13)00985-0/fulltext#bb0005), the immediate following comment by D. Ullman on the issue and the contrasting opinion by Prof. C. Boiron in this journal [1](https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(13)00985-0/fulltext#) , [2](https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(13)00985-0/fulltext#), did not contribute to achieve a clear overview about this topic, quite the contrary. Honestly, <mark class="hltr-red">the ongoing encouraging sale of Oscillococcinum® could not care less both of the many criticisms in evidence based medicine (EBM) and people confidence. People appear to trust homeopathy as an effective approach by hearsay</mark>: this elicits a positive attitude that may also promote a placebo response. However, even those medicines from homeopathy, used as placebo by physicians, may bear potential damage to patients [3](https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(13)00985-0/fulltext#bb0015): this obviously raises a bioethical concern.
