Anti Infection Drink

Before this drink I thought I'd mention this :

Doterra flu bomb works wonders – even if don't have flu hmmm

In OO sized empty capsule – taken 1x/day usually at night and usually just 1x/day when u have a cold (don't wait til night if you feel it coming on sooner!) Even if everything so called gone by next day  -  take it every night for next 5 nights anyway …

(can youtube.com for more info type in doterra flu bomb and see impossible # of testimonials)

3 drops of oregano oil

5 drops of lemon oil

5 drops of OnGuard

5 drops of melaleuca (real living form of tea tree oil)

3 drops of frankincense oil (some do 5)  if you look at google.com for all the research on frankincense -  the results on it from research before 1900 and a little into 1900s you will find a freakish amt of anti – cancer info and anti viral info (ESPECIALLY) and more more more – a cabal bought out the entire brigade of info on frankincense in 1900 hence it's why no info on it talking about this anymore… hmmm

anyway I do this ea night just b/c it makes you feel great in morning too.. ooo btw, did you know that taking of EOs (essential oils) makes you absorb items (foods and other herbs) about 20x more than normal?? Of course Methuselah is superior to that but whatever…

**Next**

**Directions for Anti-Infection drink  (simple version – major is mentioned below )**

**1 x per day is the norm – except when have the Big C or other issues going on like massive infections… see file Anti-Infection drink  for more info….**

 **Basic One:**

**1 cup water in a blender with**

**2 lemons squeezed in each time (including the seeds – throw the rind away)**

**4+ Tbl of honey ( I get raw and unheated)**

**2 cloves of garlic**

**1 tsp of ginger pwd (or if have a decent blender then ½ inch of ginger root alive)**

**2-3 TBL of raw white onion (not yellow or red or purple – white makes you cry most – it's the most powerful)**

**1 Tbl of turmeric powder (or prefer one whole root of turmeric live – sometimes in produce section of grocery near the ginger – it's about 2 inches long)**

**1 TBL of beet juice crystals**

**10 drops of lemon oil (15 is also plausible with all the honey and other ingredients in here)**

**Optional 1 tsp or one pinch of 40K Heat Unit Cayenne pepper**

**Optional 2 to 3 inches of Aloe Vera inner gel from LIVE aloe plant (the super large one sold at AloeKing.com – 12 of them or so for $37 delivered – but most Mexican and other groceries have them now in produce section incl'g Walmart! Just depends on which Walmart of course) (peel it and throw in 2 to 3 inches of the gel) (do not use the aloe liquid gallon jugs they sell with preservatives)**

**Blend and drink immediately!  Do not sip – it does not taste bad so do not be "careful" with drinking it .**

**Major version - ( just double the garlic and onion and ginger – will need to eat black beans to control the horrendous heat of doing Major – 4 forkfulls of black beans after drinking this is usually enough to control the heat and pain in stomach after consuming a Major)**

**[I'll do a recap with more info on these 2 later – but if going to grocery store these are the basics…call me if need lemon oil or Beet Juice Crystals]**

**Next**

Infections – such as cold, flu, respiratory infections, like Bronchitis, and laryngitis and strep throat and sore throat, whooping cough etc.

Hmm, cold, synonym for "body is stopped up" please take a fast… stop eating and leave me alone for a day or two with nothing but water and no food… but most people do not listen to their body and do not want to stop eating to allow the body to unstop, therefore you can kill the infection quickly by doing the below…

If you tackle this problem at the veryyy first sign of being hit by it, for example, when you first feel a litttttle soreness while swallowing, then immediately take care of it and it will usually be gone before the sun rises, but if you wait, or worse if it takes 2-3 days b4 you do anything about it, you could be in for some serious annoyance and it might take 3 days or 4 to get rid of the cold or flu or strep or sore throat or etc… (lot better than the 2 weeks most people go thru but anyway…)

This is the protocol for an adult… #1 take three alligin (see source list) at first sign of problem, then take the honeyaid/garlic/ginger recipe below, then eat one apple ( or two if you did the full blown recipe with 5 cloves garlic), then drink one cup fresh squeezed grapefruit juice (not grape juice)…eat oranges like a crazy person, like 7 to 10 a day… take 10 capsules of Solaray Rosehips or any powdered rosehips that has NO vitamin C added (b4 or after the drink or with the alligin makes no difference!)  Do this at night too, unless it is already night then take 15 to 20 capsules of rosehips…and go to bed, the rosehips will be perfect right before bed anyway, not that they knock you out, but they're good for making sleep easy and will make you drowsy… too bad they can't be taken all the time for sleep, but no way the human body could take in that much rosehips…it'd be an overdose to take that many rosehips for more than 7 days… anyway, some people prefer to skip most of what I say about doing all the steps above and take alligin 3 caps, 3x/day, that's wise too, or skip that and take only the rosehips!  If you wish to take your chances then skip the recipe and do both the rosehips and the alligin 3x/day (but don't overdue rosehips - do not exceed 20-25 caps for the day and never do that for more than 2 days!!!  If infection is NOT gone in 2 days with that many rosehips you are NOT to repeat it! It's just wasting time!  Also, don't do rosehips when you're pregnant unless it's simple rosehip tea!)…. With alligin it's hard to ever go wrong with it, can't really take too much b/c if you do you will feel pain in your tummy lol …  Anyway, this protocol - the entireee protocol is to be done 3x/day and since no human can take that much garlic without eating plenty of apples and eating veggies in between you need to do that too…. Personally I would alter the amount of garlic if it was reallllly bad…

NOTE:  Side effect note of taking too many rosehips… eyes detox majorly… that is, they start to itch like you can't imagine, it's just worms being forced out and other parasite and filth coming out your eyes, simple to fix though, just take an eyecup and wash your eyes with Neutralizer (I use the Neutralizer 3x) you will find it amazingly soothing and shouldddd take care of the itching within mins… I have found however it becomes worse if you try this with say… regular water… lol… you get the idea… I'll find you that info on the source list…Neutralizer liquid is available from

NOTE: If you have bronchitis you must eat liver and onions and do so quickly too…if bronchitis is full blown crazy coughing type, then that is the worstttt case scenario of all and you must do this recipe (and rest of protocol) exactly as stated for 3x/day…

Recipe:

Honeyaid Garlic Ginger drink for major infections, you will note this will stop coughing very quickly:

This is the major one when someone is seriously suffering like major coughing fits and serious bronchitis! The regular version of this recipe will be shown after this one below and is used when over at friends house suffering with infection or cold/flu or laryngitis, etc etc or for self or just for no reason 2x/week as a major little liver blaster to free it from anything that might be annoying it unbeknownst to you.  In case you ever have to use this major version of the anti-infection drink, though,  remember that you will have to eat some beef liver and onions, and eat some veggies after taking the entire blender drink… thus it will go in this order, do the blender drink and drink it, then drink the grapefruit juice mentioned below, then eat the apples, then eat the carrot, then eat some liver and onions and plenty of veggies, you must GETTTT stuffed, do not stop when you are full or your body will not have enough resistance to the heat of cayenne/garlic (via veggies eaten) to withstand taking this Major Anti-Infection drink again!!  And when you needddd to drink it 3x/day you will NEED to make sure you've eaten plenty of veggies so that you can do it 3x/day otherwise it will be impossible to get it down it's just too much !

**Major version almost never used :**

1 ½ - 2 cups of water

honey to taste - put in more than usual b/c hot items make it easier for honey to work

1-2 whole lemons squeezed in

(if you have it, please use 2 to 4 drops of lemon oil too, wowoowwoow what a taste)

5 garlic cloves, ie, the size of – uh, from your thumb nail beginning to tip of thumb

1 inch of ginger root or 2 tsp max of ginger powder

(note: never exceed 2 tsp of ginger powder, it will cause headaches as it cleans you out)

1 tsp of cayenne 40,000 heat units is enough never less - though than 40,000 HU

(note:  some people take weeks to get used to 1 tsp of cayenne, so ifff you're not used to it, this will be hot, so use that aloe to lessen the heat of the cayenne – though all the heat of cayenne will disappear in about 10 mins to 20 mins regardless, if you cannot take cayenne, then put in a pinch, do whatever you can do)

little horseradish root… cut off size of about one section on your pinky finger, or less (again, most people will leave this out b/c can't find it, also leave it out if you're pregnant… still, best to not do this drink at all if you're pregnant b/c of garlic content too, too much for baby, though cayenne can be good IN SMALLLLL AMOUNTS otherwise bad for a  baby b/c too much heat – I prefer women to leave it alone altogether.)

1 tsp of echinacea angustafolia (most people will leave this out b/c can't find it which is fine)

2 to 3 tbl of raw white onion (just estimate it)

Last - cut out the gel from 2 inches worth of a large aloe leaf and put the gel in the blender, throw away the skin – see source list… the aloe will Dramatically cut the heat of this drink!  Not to mention it is a potent source of all things good, and forces absorption of anything good that is eaten with it by 2 to 3 times and cuts absorption of anything bad eaten with it by 50% or so… so uh, just how is it that aloe knows what is good and what is bad for us???? Hmmm… (it is plausible, but I don't like it, to get store bought aloe juice with the preservatives in it if you want to do it that way)

Blend and drink

Note:  If it is hurting your stomach after drinking this b/c of the garlic heat and the cayenne heat, no problem, just instead eat 4 large spoonfuls of black beans OR pinto beans out of a can and all pain in the stomach will disappear… It nullifies all heat from cayenne and garlic in the stomach (not in the mouth or throat though, but that will disappear by itself in 20 mins or less anyway.)

Next, you have to drink one cup of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, then eat 2 apples and then eat 1 carrot, all in that order, take your time if you need to but the apples will do a decent job of removing garlic and cayenne heat as well!!!!  They must be eaten as well, they cannot be stuck into the blender drink

For kids, you must cut the garlic and ginger to small amounts and anything less than major problem infection, cut the garlic to 2 cloves and one tsp ginger powder or ½ inch ginger root… you get the idea…

**Regular version of anti-infection drink** I take all the time (about 2x/week just b/c I can)

Use when have anyyy feeling of an infection coming on!  Easy enough to drink few times a day without stuffing self with veggies…

1 ½ - 2 cups of water

honey to taste - put in more than usual b/c hot items make it easier for honey to work

1-2 whole lemons squeezed in

(if you have it, please use 2 to 4 drops of lemon oil too, wowoowwoow what a taste)

1-2 garlic cloves, ie, the size of – uh, from your thumb nail beginning to tip of thumb

1/2 inch of ginger root or 1 tsp max of ginger powder

(note: never exceed 2 tsp of ginger powder, it will cause headaches as it cleans you out)

1 pinch to 1/4 tsp of cayenne 40,000 heat units is enough – never use less than 40,000 HU

(note:  some people take weeks to get used to 1 tsp of cayenne, so ifff you're not used to it, this will be hot, so use that aloe to lessen the heat of the cayenne – though all the heat of cayenne will disappear in about 10 mins to 20 mins regardless, if you cannot take cayenne, then put in a pinch, do whatever you can do)

little horseradish root… cut off size of about thickness of ½ thickness of pinky finger or less (again, most people will leave this out b/c can't find it, also leave it out if you're pregnant… still, best to not do this drink at all if you're pregnant b/c of garlic content too, too much for baby, though cayenne can be good IN SMALLLLL AMOUNTS otherwise bad for a  baby b/c too much heat – I prefer women to leave it alone altogether.)

1 tsp of echinacea angustafolia (most people will leave this out b/c can't find it which is fine)

2 to 3 tbl of raw white onion (just estimate it)

Not to mention it is a potent source of all things good, and forces absorption of anything good that is eaten with it by 2 to 3 times and cuts absorption of anything bad eaten with it by 50% or so… so uh, just how is it that aloe knows what is good and what is bad for us???? Hmmm… (it is plausible, but I don't like it, to get store bought aloe juice with the preservatives in it if you want to do it that way)

Blend and drink

Note:  If it is hurting your stomach after drinking this b/c of the garlic heat and the cayenne heat, no problem, just instead eat 4 large spoonfuls of black beans OR pinto beans out of a can and all pain in the stomach will disappear… It nullifies all heat from cayenne and garlic in the stomach (not in the mouth or throat though, but that will disappear by itself in 20 mins or less anyway.)

For kids, you must cut the garlic and ginger to small amounts and anything less than major problem infection, cut the garlic to 2 cloves and one tsp ginger powder or ½ inch ginger root… you get the idea…

I personally do this drink every 3 to 4  days just for the heck of it, (ie, 2x/week) and it does something to make my liver veryyy happy with me!  I don't know how else to explain that!  So I do this drink every Tues and Every Saturday… but chose to do it how you like.. I eat two apples after…this I do as a biweekly supplement…

Note:  for those doing this version, the regular version, you can if you want leave out all the liver and onions, and the veggie eating, and apples and carrots and grapefruit juice, but I really warn you against leaving out the apples, the apples make for the extreme easy life when it comes to detoxing, so don't leave those out please!

**KIDS VERSION**

There are a lot of kids that will just not let this stuff in their mouth despite being 11 years old… I have had mothers instead make some realllly good honeyaid, then… cut of garlic reallllllllyyyyy reallllllllyyyyy tiny then put it in an empty capsule and make them swallow it then do same with encapsulating some ginger powder… I have seen week long coughs disappear in ONE night doing this on one 11 year old girl after suffering for 2 weeks with a cough that would not quit!   Just ONE single cap ea of ginger and garlic (the garlic melted the cap by the way and it still worked lol so encapsulate and take it quickly!)

Most of you will just want to do the pill route and eating oranges as mentioned in the beginning, but at the very least make sure you add Honeyaid to your diet on a daily basis you will find when it is perfectly prepared it is bizarrely addictive … this is a rare thing in a super hydrating and good for you formula… anyway, here's how to make it:

Recipe:

Honeyaid:  buy one gallon of water… pour 5 cups of that water down the drain, throw it away, and put 2 cups of that water in a blender then add 2 ½ cups of honey, then blend for 10 seconds, and put back into the gallon container, next juice fresh lemons til have 1 ½ cups of lemon juice, and pour back into container… this leaves enough room to add more honey or lemon to make it just right if not perfect yet, shake it up and put in fridge, when you are sick, drink this as hot as you can stand it, it will go straight after your kidneys to clean them up and strengthen them…it will hydrate you also like you can't imagine, put a pinch of salt in to each glass too to make it even more hydrating.

Years ago I had a best friend in college, after knowing her for about 3 months she says hey by the way did I tell you my dad has been on a dialysis machine for 7 years now… not gone to the bathroom for 7 years just uses that machine, at which I replied, are kidding me, what's wrong with you, why didn't you tell me this sooner! Lol… I told her to turn around and we went immediately the store, got plain honey, lemons and water and I proceeded to boil the water, and squeeze lemon after lemon into that water and put in some honey til tasted good, then gave it to him hot to drink… she told me the next day he drank that glass and then another one later that night and next morning went to the bathroom for the first time in 7 years!  Now … that's Honeyaid…

It has no addictiveness when it's hot unfortunately, but it is extremely addictive cold!  So…drink it cold too!!!! J PLEASE! Get Addicted to this!

Dr. Christopher:

The recipe is a simple combination of honey, cayenne pepper and garlic. All of these are among the most affordable herbs available. The idea is to make healing syrup out of these materials, and coat the throat with a tablespoon of the mixture every one or two waking hours. Taking multiple dosages may be annoying, but when you are in a situation where you need to get to work the next day, or just want to feel better, it is a godsend.

After taking the tablespoon of syrup, it is important not to drink water immediately afterwards, or wash the mixture away, as the idea is to get the soothing aspect of the honey, and disinfecting action of the garlic to stick to the sore area.

To make the syrup, mix 1 part honey with 1 part minced garlic, and add as much cayenne pepper as you are comfortable taking (usually 1/8 of a teaspoon of 40,000 H.U cayenne to the tablespoon for most people).

If you are concerned about the odor of garlic, there is an effective way to get around it. We at the herb shop understand this more than we care to admit! If you have some _whole clove buds_ that have not been stored too long or irradiated, you may chew or suck on these as you would a breath mint. Nothing gets past the pleasant aromatics of the clove bud.

[within 1 day usually no more sore throat with this above recipe!!!]

Subject: Lemon Juice !

Date: Tuesday, November 22, 2011, 2:02 AM

LISTEN UP FOLKS:   This is something that we should all take seriously.Even doctors are now saying that there is value in trying LEMON.

So, a tablespoon of "real lemon" (the concentrate in a bottle) in a glass of water every morning. What can it  hurt?

The surprising benefits of lemon!

I remain perplexed!

Institute of Health Sciences, 819 N. L.L.C. Charles Street Baltimore, MD

This is the latest in medicine, effective for cancer!

Read carefully & you be the judge.

Lemon   (Citrus ) is a miraculous product to kill cancer cells . It is 10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy .

 Why do we not know about that? Because there are laboratories interested in making a synthetic version that will bring them huge profits. You can now help a friend in need by letting him/her know that lemon juice is beneficial in preventing the disease. Its taste is pleasant and it does not produce the horrific effects of chemotherapy. How many people will die while this closely guarded secret is kept, so as not to jeopardize the beneficial multimillionaires large corporations? 

As you know, the lemon tree is known for its varieties of lemons and limes. You can eat the fruit in different ways: you can eat the pulp, juice press, prepare drinks, sorbets, pastries, etc...It is credited with many  virtues, but the most interesting is the effect it produces on cysts and tumors. This plant is a proven remedy against cancers of all types.. Some say it is very useful in all variants of cancer . 

It is considered also as an anti microbial spectrum against bacterial infections and fungi, effective against internal parasites and worms, it regulates blood pressure which is too high and an antidepressant, combats stress and nervous disorders. The source of this information is fascinating: it comes from one of the largest drug manufacturers in the world, says that after more than 20 laboratory tests since 1970, the extracts revealed that: It destroys the malignant cells in 12 cancers , including colon, breast, prostate, lung and pancreas ... The compounds of this tree showed 10,000 times better than the product Adriamycin, a drug normally used chemotherapeutic in the world, slowing the growth of cancer cells. And what is even more astonishing: this type of therapy with lemon extract only destroys malignant cancer cells and it does not affect healthy cells.

[Very similar to my anti-infection drink but takes forever to make (2 weeks til it's done)… also I would have used salt and lemon juice instead of ACV – but I digress… I have been habitually using turmeric in my anti infection drink too for quite some time – I decided against using horseradish b/c too powerful and undrinkable but I've told people about it forever….

Winkie Pratney Juice

### Master Tonic - bye bye colds!

![[master-tonic.jpg]]

  
I have just completed my first batch of "Master Tonic" (also known as Winkie Juice to Ywamers). It is one of the greatest natural remedies for colds, ailments, infections and illnesses. It is known as a modern day plague tonic. You can of course use it as a preventative and I intend to test it this winter to keep colds at bay.  
  
I first heard about it 13 years ago from a speaker and chemist called Winkie Pratney. The taste isn't everyone's cup of tea but the health benefits are so worth it.  
  
  
Here is the recipe:  
  
Ingredients:  
1 bottle of unfiltered, organic apple cider vinegar  
Equal parts of fresh:  
Ginger  
Garlic  
Onion  
Horseradish root (couldn't find any myself, so just used jar stuff)  
Hot chillies (habenero, scotch bonet, seranos, indian, etc)  
- Dice all of the ingredients finely (you can even blend them) and fill 3/4 of the way in an airtight jar. Fill to the top (leaving an inch) with apple cider vinegar.    
- Let it marinate together for 2 weeks in a dark cupboard, shaking at least once a day.  
- Strain out the veggies and fill into airtight bottles.   
  
It lasts for up to a year in a dark cupboard or in the fridge. Take a tablespoon once a day, or 4-5 times a day if you're sick. Good luck...let me know if you try it! :)

# The Most Powerful Natural Antibiotic Ever: The Medieval Tonic That Treats All Diseases

| February 13, 2015 | [General](http://www.healthylifetricks.com/category/general/) | [1 Comment](http://www.healthylifetricks.com/powerful-natural-antibiotic-ever-medieval-tonic-treats-diseases/#comments)

This tonic has helped many people to heal from a variety of viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal diseases and even from the plague! Its strength shouldn't be underestimated.

It can cure most chronic conditions and diseases. Encourages maximum blood circulation and purifies the blood. This formula has helped millions of people throughout the centuries against the most deadly diseases.

**The secret lies in the powerful combination of natural, fresh ingredients!**

So to summarize, this tonic is effective in the treatment of all diseases, successfully strengthens the immune system, acts as an antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic drug. It helps in the most severe infections.

![[robert-von-1.jpg]]

**Mediaeval Tonic – Recipe**

It is preferable to wear gloves during the preparation, especially during handling hot peppers because later it is difficult to remove the tingling! The smell is very strong, caution, it may immediately get your sinuses to work.

**Ingredients:**

– 700 ml of apple cider vinegar

– ¼ cup finely chopped garlic

– ¼ cup finely grated onions

– 2 of the hottest fresh peppers that you can find (careful cleaning – wear gloves !!!)

– ¼ cup grated ginger

– 2 tablespoons grated horseradish

– 2 tablespoons turmeric powder or 2 pieces of turmeric root

**Preparation:**

Mix all ingredients except the apple cider vinegar in bowl. Transfer them to a large glass jar. Pour the apple cider vinegar into the jar. Close and shake. Leave the jar in a cool dry place for two weeks. Every day, shake it as many times as you can, but at least once.

After 14 days, strain through a sieve with a cheesecloth added plus. The rest of the dry mixture can be used in cooking. The resulting liquid is your tonic. No need to keep it in the refrigerator.

Tip: You can also use it in the kitchen – mix it with olive oil and use it as a salad dressing or stewing.

**Dosage For The Medieval Tonic:**

Caution: The flavor is very strong, very hot!

Tip: Prepare and eat a slice of orange, lemon or lime after you take the tonic to ease the burning. Put the tonic in the mouth, gargle briefly, swallow. Do not dilute it with water because the effect will not be as strong.

For strengthening the immune system and treating cold, drink 1 tablespoon each day.

Take it slow to drinking a dose of 1 small glass a day (cup of liquor).

If you are fighting some serious illness and infection, take 1 tablespoon of the tonic 5-6 times a day.

Can be used during pregnancy and it is safe for children (use small doses!) Because the ingredients are natural and non-toxic.
