The theory has been set forth that a "prolonged absence of food brings about a reduction in circulating blood sugar, causing glycogen (stored carbohydrate) levels to fall. That leaves your body no choice but to rely more on fat, rather than glucose, to fuel workouts. Moreover, the low insulin levels associated with fasting are conducive to fat breakdown, increasing the availability of fatty acids to be used as energy during the exercise session."[1](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-myth-of-cardio-before-breakfast-debunked.html)

Unfortunately, the counter evidence is more compelling: "it's shortsighted to simply look at the number of fat calories burned during an exercise session. Your metabolism doesn't operate in a vacuum. Rather, the body continually adjusts its use of fat and carbohydrate for fuel depending on a variety of factors. . . . if you burn more carbohydrate while exercising, you'll ultimately burn more fat in the post-workout period and vice versa. . . . True, the research does show that fasted cardio can increase fat utilization during exercise compared to performing cardio in the fed state. Except this only occurs at very low levels of training intensity. During moderate-to-high intensity levels, the body continues to break down significantly more fat when fasted compared to after you've eaten.

You can break down fat faster than you can use it for energy: "Unfortunately, the rate of breakdown exceeds your body's ability to use the extra fatty acids for fuel. In other words, you have a lot of extra fatty acids floating around in the blood that can't be used by working muscles. Ultimately, these fatty acids are repackaged into triglycerides post-workout, and then shuttled back into fat cells. So you've gone to excessive lengthsâ€¦only to wind up at the same place."[1](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-myth-of-cardio-before-breakfast-debunked.html)

Fed or fasted doesn't make a difference in low intensity workouts for the first 90 minutes: "the benefits of fasted cardio on fat utilization are negligible even at low levels of intensity. Horowitz and colleagues (2) found that when trained subjects exercised at 50 percent of their max heart rate, an intensity that equates to a slow walk, there was no difference in the amount of fat burned--regardless of whether the subjects had eaten. These results held true for the first 90 minutes of exercise; only after this period did fasted cardio begin producing a favorable shift in the amount of fat burned."[1](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-myth-of-cardio-before-breakfast-debunked.html)

"Fasted cardio makes even less sense when you take into account the impact of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption. EPOC, commonly referred to as the "afterburn," represents the number of calories expended after training. Guess what? Eating before exercise promotes substantial increases in EPOC."[1](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-myth-of-cardio-before-breakfast-debunked.html)

"On top of everything, fasted cardio can have a catabolic effect on muscle. Studies show that training in a glycogen-depleted state substantially increases the amount of tissue proteins burned for energy during exercise."[1](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/the-myth-of-cardio-before-breakfast-debunked.html)

"More Muscle = Higher Metabolism. . . . The absolute best way to get the greatest caloric expenditure over the whole day from cardio is to do it in what's called the post-absorptive state. That means not in a fasted state, but not while you're still digesting either. Doing cardio after you just ate will lead to less fat oxidation and more glucose oxidation."[2](https://www.t-nation.com/training/fasted-cardio-eats-muscle)
