# Chest

## Dumbbells

### Incline dumbbell bench press

Why: While the bench press is the chest-bulking staple, dumbbell presses offer different variants to help you build a bigger chest. By using two separate weights, you have a greater range of motion, while activating more stabilising muscles too.

To make it harder, Take the weight all the way to the top of the movement before lowering the opposite side to keep your chest under tension.

How:

- Lie back on a bench set to a 45-degree angle and lift the weights over your chest, palms facing away from you.

- Slowly lower one weight, then drive it back up and squeeze your chest at the top.

- Repeat with the other side.

## Cables

### Cable fly

Why: Give your pectorals and deltoids a new stimulus instead of pressing. Add the cable fly to your chest day to provide constant tension throughout the full movement.

How:

- Attach stirrup handles to the high pulleys of a cable crossover machine.

- Take one in each hand â€“ your arms should be outstretched with a slight bend.

- Place one foot slightly forward, brace your core, and pull the handles downward and across your body. Return to the start position under control

## Push-ups


### Decline press-up

Why: Decline bench press-ups place the muscle-building emphasis on your lower pectorals, helping you build a well-rounded and more defined chest.

How:

- Place your feet on a bench with your hands planted on the floor in front of you.

- Lower your body down until your chest almost reaches the floor.

- Press your body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest.

- Pause briefly at the top before repeating.

### Staggered press-up

Why: If you've already mastered press-ups, then this is an ideal stepping-stone into mastering the one-handed press-up.

How:

- Get into a press-up position with your hands staggered, so your right is further forward then the left.

- Lower your body until your chest is an inch from the ground then drive up explosively.

- Pull your hands off the floor and switch positions so your left leads, then repeat.

### Clap press-up

Why: Scorch your fast-twitch muscle fibres and prime them for growth with this plyometric take on the bodyweight classic

How:

- Get into a push-up position, your hands just outside your chest, your feet shoulder-width apart, and your body forming a straight line from head to heels. Brace your core.

- Lower your chest to the floor and then press up explosively so your hands come off the floor, clapping once at the top of the movement.
