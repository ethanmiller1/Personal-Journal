## Role of Garlic in Health

Garlic can rightfully be called one of nature's wonderful plants with healing power. It can inhibit and kill bacteria, fungi, lower (blood pressure, blood cholesterol and blood sugar), prevent blood clotting, and contains anti-tumor properties. It can also boost the immune system to fight off potential disease and maintain health (Abdullah et al., 1988). It has the ability to stimulate the lymphatic system which expedites the removal of waste products from the body. It is also considered an effective antioxidant to protect cells against free radical damage. It can help to prevent some forms of cancer, heart disease, strokes and viral infections. Garlic alone can provide us with over two hundred unusual chemicals that have the capability of protecting the human body from a wide variety of diseases. The sulfur containing compounds found in garlic afford the human body with protection by stimulating the production of certain beneficial enzymes (Mansell and Reckless, 1991).<sup>3</sup>

### *Antiviral*

In 2001, a double blind placebo controlled study has shown significant protection from the common cold virus.<sup>2</sup> However more recently another study found the number of days to recovery from an occurrence of the common cold was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63).
