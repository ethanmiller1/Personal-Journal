"Bootstrapping" comes from the term "pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps." That much you can get from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap).

In computing, a bootstrap loader is the first piece of code that runs when a machine starts, and is responsible for loading the rest of the operating system. It usually applies to a situation where a system depends on itself to start, sort of a chicken and egg problem. In that case, bootstrapping refers to a way of breaking the circular dependency, usually with the help of an external entity.
