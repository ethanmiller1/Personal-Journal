Software is the backbone of our modern era. It's the venue where we do business, it's where we learn and get information, it's where we connect through social media, and I find that very exciting. I want to be a part of it.

I mean, I have my Bible app, my scripture me.pry app, my prayer mate app, my hymns app.

# 5 Year Vision

Hopefully working at a software company where I can use my passion and skills to build applications that make tasks more efficient and increase the value of labor hours. Software is the current industrial revolution. It's the reason you can shop online instead of driving to the store. It's the reason you can rename 1000 video files in a couple of minutes instead of two weeks. I have missionaries in PNG, and it takes the whole tribe with machetes to cut the grass. One man with a lawn mower can do that. Software helps improve the world by increasing the value of labor hours.

Software is what sharpens the axe to let people do things more effectively. Work smarter, not harder.

I don't want to use the word improving because it will sound like I'm trying to be clever, but they're improving the technology to enable people to spend more time doing things that they love. Building cities, planting gardens, laying roads, connecting the world. Software is the backbone of the modern era.

One company is a small part of that direction, but we are a part. And we're a part of something big, and I don't want to miss out on that.

The Bible says to redeem the time because the days are evil. Let's do that. Let's redeem the time by making things easier, simpler, better.

All things are full of labor, man cannot utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. I know it's popular to love your job, but my job is the means, not the end. My 5 year goal is to be happily married with a good job that enables me to provide for my family.

If you wanted me to say software, that's part of it. Software is the backbone of progress in our modern era. We had the industrial revolution, and right now we're in the middle of a 60 year digital revolution, and it's still getting better and more proficient and more widespread. I think that's great, and if I can be a part of it, great. The Bible says whatever thy hands find to do, do with all thy might, as unto the Lord and not for men. It doesn't matter what I'm doing, if I'm doing it for the Lord, I'm going to do it happily.

# Why Improving?

Number one because of what you guys do. Improving the world.

But that's not what makes your company stand out. What makes your company stand out is the people on your team. The culture that I read about on your website. Built on excellence, dedication, involvement, and built on a foundation of trust. Everybody chooses their adjectives carefully. When you choose to talk about your principles over and against track record or your monetary success, I'm impressed.

From what I understand and everything I've been told, your company lives up to its name.

I suppose it's because your company is not just about programs, it's about people. And that's important to me, because I have a passion for both.

The industrial revolution enabled a farmer who created enough food for 10 families to create enough food for 100 families, enabling 10 other farmers to free up their time to do other things. Build cities, roads, civilization. That was made possible by making tools that make your labor hour more time efficient and quality effective. Right now we're in the middle of a 60 yea digital revolution, and we're still making things easier, simpler, better. Software exists to make things more efficient.

I was digitizing our families 300 DVD's, and I had to name it, "Title (Year)." Which meant I had to manually search IMDB for the year of each movie. Instead I wrote a Python program to get the DVD label, search IMDB, and copy the Title and year to the Clip board. Saved a ton of time. The Bible says to redeem the time because the days are evil.
