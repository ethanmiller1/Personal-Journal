The best budgeting app I have found is YNAB. My dad bought a lifetime license to YNAB 4 accessible in my professional journal under a file named "Secrets". That version of YNAB has since become obsolete, and I will eventually migrate to the subscription based version of YNAB. I've put it off for some time as I think there is value in manually inputting transactions as opposed to automating the process. Automation allows you to lose conscientiousness about your finances. That was my experience using Mint. However, I recently bought an iPhone and I cannot load the YNAB 4 app onto it even with jailbreaking it, so I have faced the reality that migrating is inevitable if I want to continue with conscious budgets. In the mean time I will manually update my budgets by exporting bank transactions, modifying them in VS Code with multiple cursor functionality, [format the CVS file](https://aniav.github.io/ynab-csv/), and [importing the result](https://support.youneedabudget.com/en_us/formatting-a-csv-file-an-overview-BJvczkuRq) into YNAB 4.
