To complete this assignment, first answer the following questions. You can ask your parents about some of the information if you wish.  You can also go to the library and find the correct answers (there are various reference books available such as almanacs and books on personal finance). There are also sources available on the Internet--websites such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Yahoo! Finance, smartaboutmoney.org, irs.gov, Edmunds.com, bankrate.com, zwillow.com, ebby.com and "Consumer Resources" on the Dallas Fed homepage. The answers are there--it's your job to find them!  

After you answer the questions, write a summary of what you have learned about personal economics. You should emphasize: (1) the relationship between potential income and spending, (2) the total dollar cost of financing cars and houses, (3) the cost of financing purchases on credit cards, and (4) anything that surprised you. Also discuss how this information might be of use to you in making future personal economic decisions. The summary should be either word processed, or printed.

List any other websites you found useful/interesting for this assignment.

Add your personal economics summary and any useful websites you found.

It might be smart to live off of your parents' expense until you have enough money to pay for the initial costs of living on your own (such as a house and car). Total interest paid on home plus car loans (assuming you take out a loan for the full amount) will run up to $191,018.13. Cutting off utility costs plus food and other periodic expenses your parents pay, you can save an additional $1,369.34 per month until you move out. At an income of $78,600, after income tax and social security / medicare tax, you're left with $57,080. Assuming you spend about $5,000 on gear and gadgets / leisure time activities per year, it would take only about 5 years and 4 and a half months of saving to purchase a house and car with cash on the barrel, avoiding $191,018.13 in loan interest over 30 years.
